8 κ INTRODUCTION TO THE

for the rearrangement; (c) that if we deduci the variation caused by
this purpose, the order in which the Odes are placed bears distinct
witness in favour of the common arrangement ¹. Diomedes, the
writer on metre (who is quoted by Priscian, and therefore cannot be
later than the fifth century), refers to the Odes by their present
numbering.

ξ 11. It has also a considerable amount of infernal evidence, in the
testimony (distinctas far as it goes, ewen if it do not prove much) of
Book iv3--in the general analogy of Horace's other collections of
poems 3—and in many indications of design (or at the least of amiud
at work in the disposition), which on the one hand are inconsistent
with the theory of a haphazard redivision os a mass of poems whose
original arrangement had been lost, and which on the other, in
several points suit well with known characteristics of Horace's
taste.

1. Few can doubt that the references in the First Ode of Book iv
to 1. 19 and 3. 26, imply that these Odes must have stood in
Horace's disposition pretty much where they do now, as one of the
earliest and the latest olbis love Odes. ’

a. Some kind of conscious arrangement, subsequent to compo-
sition and not chronological, is obvious on the face of the Epodes,
the Satires, and the Epistles. If there is nothing else, there is the
manifest choice of an opening poem, not usually it would seem, if
ever, earliest in date of composition ², an apology for the style of
writing asin Sat. ii, or a quasi-dedicatory address to his patron as
in the Epodes, Sat. i, and both Books of Epistles. The analogy
between Odes i-iii and Epp. i is closer still, in the assignment of
the first place and the last but one to Maecenas (od. 1. 1 and 3. 29,

Epp. 1r 1 and 19), while the last in both cases (Od. 3. 30, Epp. 1. ao)
is reserved for the poet's own literary seli-consciousness³.

The Bourth Book of the Odes stands apart from other collections
in that the greater part at least of it was notoriously composed with a
purpose3 and therefore the plan of arrangement may have been
