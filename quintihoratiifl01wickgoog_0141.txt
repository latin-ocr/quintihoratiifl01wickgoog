HORATII CARMINUM

Vix una sospes navis ab ignibus,
Mentemque lymphatam Mareotico
Redegit in veros timores

Caesar, ab Italia volantem
Remis adurgens, accipiter velut
Molles columbas aut leporem citus
Venator in campis nivalis
Haemoniae, daret ut catenis ιο
Fatale monstrum: quae generosius
Perire quaerens nec muliebriter
Expavit ensem nec latentes
Classe cita reparavit oras ;

13. vix uua sospes. For the con-
struction cp. 2. 4. 10 ‘ademptus Hector
Tradidit. . Pergama Graiis) Horace,
in the desire to omit Antony’s name,
does not distinguish his ficet, which was
totally destroyed, from, that of Cleo·
plm' which flerl without striking a
bow.

14. lymphatam, ‘panio-strichen?
ΡιοριιΙγενυμφόπληιιτον, panic terrors
being attributed tothe agency, amougst
other deities, nithe Nymphs; but the
word, like panio itself, is generalised.
Here the effect is attributed to her
revelswithAntonyand the deep draughts
of Egyptian wine, for Bacchus too is the
author of such empty fears: cp. Eur.
Bacch. 303 foll. στρατὸν ’γὰρ ἐν ὅπλοις
ὄντα κάπὶ τάξεσι φόβοι διεπτόησε πρὶν
λόγχης θιγεῖν· μανία δὲ real τοῦτ’ ἐστὶ
Διονύσου πάρα. It is opposed to ‘veros
timores,¹ ⁴ ffle fears of sobemess.’

Mareotico, a sweet wine from Marea,
a town of the Delta, mentioned‘hut not
characterized byVirg. G. 2. 91.

16. ab Italia, not that she had
reached Italy, but that it was the object
of the ambitious schemas broken down
at Actium. A few of Octavius’ ships
seem to have pursued Cleopatrafor a
short way, but she escaped safely to
Alexandria. Horace marks uo interval
between this and the autumn of the
following year, when Octavius followed,
ιο put a close to the war at Alexandria,
and Antony and Cleopatra escaped his
hands by a voluntary death.

epithet probably only implies 'in winter,'
the appropriate time for hunting.

21. monstrum quae, a common con·
structio ad sensum. Cicero calls
Catiline ‘monstrum' Cat. n.1; Lucan
calls Cleopatra ‘Latii feralis Erinnys,’
10.5.

aa9 nao..snsarn. According to
Plutarch (Ant. 79) she attempted to stab
herself on the approach of Proculeius,
Augustus' emissary, but was presented.
The next line aud a half have reference
perhaps toa plan which, on the same
authority (ib. 69), she is said to have
entertained of carrying her lieet across
the isthmus, and escaping down the Red
Sea.

²4· reparavit, a word of doubtful
sense, hut found in all the MSS. and
interpreted by the Schol. Porph. took
it as a pregnant expression=‘ ad laten·
tes oras fugit ut vires inde repararet.'
It may mean no more than ‘found some
fresh land out of the way of Caesar's
vengeanoe.’ It may also mean (see on
1. 31. ιι) ‘purchased’ ‘used her fleet to
win for herself? and there may be in it a
more or less conscious remembrauce of
the Greek uses of ἀμείβειν and ἀλλάτ-
τειν, for ‘to go to' some new piace.
Bentley proposed ‘penetravit’ and there
have been many other conjectures—⁴ cit-
are paravit,’ ‘ire paravit,' ‘repetivit‚' etc.

²5· ausa et..forbis et. There is
no verb understood. These are the
grounds of the foregoing statements the
infinitive following ‘fortis' as in 1. 1.
