Tua natural meaning of the Ode is, ‘The world is full of fair spots, but your
own Tibur is the fairest. Forget your troubles, Plancus; in camp, or here in
Tibur, drown care in wine. Remember how Teucer put a hold face on his
calamity, and found a new Salamis to make up for the old)

What Plancus’ trouble was we do not know nor whether it bore any resem-

= blance to Teucer’s by involving a compulsory absence from his weil-loved Tibur.

L. Munatius Plancus was a manos no character, ‘morbo proditor,’ Vell. Pat. a.
83. He had been a friend of Julius Caesaim aster his death he changed sides
more than once between Antony and Octavius. By the latter he was made consul
in nc. 4²·

With the story of Teucer at the end of the Ode compare the conclusion of
Epod. 13.1r ad frn.

Several of the best MSS. begin a new Ode at v. 15. The! division was as old as
Porph, for hc notices and condemns it; on v. 15 ‘Hanc Qden qnidam putant aliam
esse, sed eadem est3 nam et hic ad Plancum loquitur cuins in honorem et in supe·
riore parte Tibur laudavit, Plancusenim inde fuit oriundus' There seems too
little substance in the first fourteen lines sor a separate Ode. and the recurrence to
Tiburis v. 20 is clearly the link, though a slight one. Mistakes in the matter are
common in the MSS. See Epod. 2. 23 and 9. 27. Porph. mentions and condemns
a division of Od. 3. ²4 at v. 25, though it is not so found in any extant MS. The
opposite mistake occurs in Od. 2. 14, 15, which are written continuously in several
of the oldest MSS„ although there is no conceirahle connection between them.
