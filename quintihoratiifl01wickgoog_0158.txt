ODE Vl.

‘Scammos my dear friend who would accompany me to the ends of tbe earth,
let me spend the end oi my life at Tibur, or if not there, then at Tarentum. Let us
go there together and Iive there till I die' ·

Septimius has been, naturally supposed to be the same person whom Horace
introduces to Tiberius in Epp. 1. 9. The Schol. Cruq. further identifies him with
Titius, the poet on the stall oi' the same Tiberius in Epp. 1, 3. 9 ‘Romana brevi
venturus in ora. Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus! It may probablybe the
same person who is named as the common friend oi the poet and the emperor in
Augustus' letter preserved in the Suetonlan lise of Horace.

This is one of the Odes which is assigned by several of Horace's chronologists
to a date earlier thanne. 31 (see Introd. to Books i-iii‚ t a). We must not, perhaps,
lay very much stress ou the fact that the year 29 is the earliest time at which we
know oi public attention being called to the difficulty ol subduing the Cantabri (v. a);
but the positive arguments¹ for the early date seem slight. Π the words ‘lasso
maris et viarum militiaeque’ are to be pressed (see note on v. 1), they would carry
the Ode back not onlybeyond 31, but to a time when moecenas really fresh
from his campaign, and, before he could well have become familiar with Tibur and
Tarentum. Macleane justly remarks that the tone of the Ode is not that oi a
young adventurer ireshly come to Rome to begin lise. Nor is the argument

‘ stronger irom the supposed incompatibility ol his roving tastes with his pos·

session oi the ‘unica Sabinass‘ which he obtained in ac. 34. Cp. his language in
