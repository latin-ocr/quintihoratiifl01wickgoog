HORATII CARMINUM

O D E XXVI.

Tus poet professes himself ioiled in his addresses to Chloe', and recognises the
meaning of the iailure: ‘He has made his conquests in his tirne; but his campaigns
are over. Here in Venus' temple hc will hang up the instrumente of gallantry for
which he has no rnore use. May Venus (we expect, ‘grant him peace at last:
‘spare him further love troubles ⁹) make Chloe feel one little smart of her lash.’

The conclusion points the irony ol the beginning. Compare 4. 1. lntrod.
