50 uounrrr carminum

sor the Ode in rac. 29· when Augustus, according to the statement both os
Suetonius (Oct. 28) aud of Dio Cassius (52. 1), entertained the thought of abau-
rloning the supreme power which had just fully come into his hands. Dio gives
a speech oi Maecenas on that occasion, in which he uses the very allegory oi the
Ode. As Macleane remarks, this may prove too much. It is as certain as can be
that Horace drew his image not from any speech of Maecenas, but from Alcaeus.
Maecenas or Dio may more probably have taken theirs from Horace.

The image oi a ship for the State is an old one. See, inter alia, Aesch. Sept. c.

T. 1, Soph. O. T. 25, Plat. Resp. p. 488, Theognis, 671-682.

O NAVIS, referent in mare te novi
Fluctus! Oquid agis? Fortiter occupa
Portumi Nonne videS, ut
Nudum remigio latus
Et rnalus celeri saucius Africo
Antenuaeque gemant, ac sine funibus
Vix durare carinae
Possint imperiosius
Aequor? Non tibi sunt integra lintea,
Non di, quos iterum pressa voces malo, ιο

1. referens . . novi,a double state·
ment. Fresh waves are rising, and
they will carry thee back. Horace
speaks of the civil war under the same
metaphor in Od. 2. 7. 15 ‘Te rursus in
bellum resorbens Unda fretis tulit aest·
uosisss and in Epp. a. a. 47‘Civiiis . .
belli . . aestus’r although in those cases
it is individuale, not the State, who are
battling with the waves

a. fortiter occupa porcum, ‘make
a brave eliort and gain the harbour
first,' ie. before the fresh wavcs prevent
you. The ship is still outside the bar.

4. nudum, supply ‘sit,’ as also after
'saucius' Orelli speaks os this as
‘miro zeugmate ex v. “gemant” v.
“ sit'’ elicere,' and thinks it sar more
poetical to make ‘gemant' the verb to
all three clauses, But it is a harsher
zeugma to spealr of a broadside swept
bare of nowers as ‘ groaniug' in the same
sense as yardarms. And ii ‘gemant’
apply to all three subJectS, the ‘an-
tennae' are left without any special
description of the iujury done to them.
Bentley, acceptiug the reading os some
of the less ancient MSS, ‘gemunt' ‘pos-
sunt,’ puts the question at ‘latus' mak-
ing the second staura consist oi cate·

gorical statements. For ‘vides ut. .
gemaut‚’ the particular sense of ‘ seeing’
being lost aster a time in the more
general motion oi ‘perceiving‚' cp. Od.
3. 10. 5-8 ‘Audis quo strepitu ianua . .
remugiat Ventis, et positas ut glaciet
nives luppiter‚' and Virg. Aen. 4. 490
‘mugire videbis Sub pedibus terram et
descendere montibus ornos.'

6. sine funibus. They are therino-
ζώματα of Plat. Resp. p. 616 C; cp.
Acts 27.17 flandriam ἐχρῶντο ὑποζών-
uvares τὸ πλοῖον, rupes passed round ’
the hull to prevent the timbers starting.

7. durare,Virg. Aen. 8. 577 ‘durare
laborem!

carinae, apparently a plural for a
sing.. the keel aud all that belongs to
it, the timbers that stari from it, the
hull, tbe bottom. Bentley takes it as a
proper plural, ‘Other ships about you
cannot hold without anchore!

8. imperiosius, ‘too tyrannous‚’
‘peremptory.' The sea iusists on break-
ing in, will have uo refusal.

10. non di, sc. ‘suut integri? The
images of gods which were carried ou
board as a protection to the ship; Pers.
6. 30 ‘ lacet ipse iu litore, et una Ingentes

de puppe dei’
