LIB. IV.

Illic plurima naribus

OD. r. ’

Duces thura, lyraeque et Berecyntiae

Delectabere tibiae

Mixtis carminibus non sine fistula;

Illic bis pueri die

Numen cum teneris virginibus tuum
Laedentes pede candido

ln morem Salium

ter quatient humum.

Me nec femina nec puer

Iam nec spes animi credula mutui,
Nec certare iuvat mem,

Nec vincire novis tempora floribus
Sed cur heu, Ligurine, cur

Manat rara meas lacrima per genas?
Cur facunda parum decoros

Inter verba cadit lingua silentio?

Nocturnis ego somniis

lam captum teneo, iam volucrem sequor
Te per gramina Martii

Campi, te per aquae, dure, volubiles

22. It is difficult to be certain about
either the reading or the exact meaning.
A majority of the older MSS. have
'lyraess ‘tibiae‚' but the Bland. Vet. is
among those which read ‘lyra' ‘tibia’
In that case they are ablativos, construc-
ted probably with ⁶ delectabere though
they also nray be taken after ‘mixtis'
Against the ablativa there is the unplea-
santness, to our ears at least, of four
verses out ol five ending with along ‘a’
If we read ‘aa' there is still a question
both of construction and sense. Are
‘lyrae' ‘tibiae’ genitivos after ‘carmin-
ibus’ ‘mingled strains ol harp and flute’;
ordativesasOrellithinks,after‘mirrtis'?
And in this last case does ‘carminibus’
mean the joint strains mingled‚ as we
should rather say ‘ol' than ‘with’ the
harp and flute, or are ‘carmina’ the
voices of singers to be added to the

instrumental music? More probably,
perhaps, the former, as he is speaking

tioned in the next line. For the ‘lyra’
and ‘tibia’ see on Od. 1. 1. 32, 1. ra. Ι,
