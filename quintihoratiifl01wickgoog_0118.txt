01 death by the argument that those
do not escape whom you would rnost
expect to'escape. ‘Yon the philoso-
phers, do not escape.' Archytas is sup·
posed to bring the sarne lesson horne to
the sailor by another argument. ‘The
forms and occasions of death are many;
your own tradebas its dangers3 the
young die as well as the old3 the only
fixed thing is that all die. Idied like
the rest, cast ashore, as you might be, ’
by a tempest. Be not iu such a hurry
after your gain as to reluse me the last

18. avidum, a few MSS. read ‘avi-

Dillenburger's interpretation,a hit at
the trader's eugerness for gain, ‘avidis’
is neither so delicate nor so lorcible as
,⁸ avidum,’ which means ⁶ greedy as they';
cp. Od. 1. 18. 30 ‘rapacis Orci,' where
the epithet is clearly meant 10 compare
the greediness 01 death for his prey
with the greediness 01 the rich landlord
who is laying field to field.

a reminiscence 01 the Homeris epithet,

eaput fugit. None could die (acc.
to Virg. Aen. 4. 698) till Proserpine
had cut a look 01 hair from his head;
the idea being that the dying man was
a victirn offered to the powers below
(‘ victima Orci,’ Od. 1. 3. 24), as it was
usual to begin a sacrifice by cutting =
some hairs lrom the forehead of 1110110-

fugit. The perf. tense, as Od. 2. 13.

11. Illyriois, sor the Adriatic gene-

l ne pares malignus, ‘grndge not
churlishly'; he puts it as though avarice
could be the only reason 101 his refusing.

vagae adds a touch, ‘surely the saud
that drives hither and thither before the

however, rather than sand, that he
doubts bis sparing3 ‘parce dare’ as
‘parce cavere,' Od. 3. 8. 26.

Apulia as it crosses Italy'l or do the

trader will hirnself be sailing on the
Hesperian waves? The east wind is on
