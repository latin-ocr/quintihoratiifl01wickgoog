EPODE Ill.

A moon heroic invective against garlic. Horace has caten some dish seasoned
with it at Maecenas’ table, and he treats it as a practical johe of his host's (v. 20
liocose Maecenas'). ‘Garlic should be substituted for hemlock in the punishment
os parricides. What can the reapers' stomachs be· made of? He has taken poison-

¹ viper's blood, some decoction of Canidia's-the very drug which Medea used to
prevent the bulls touching Jason‚ and to destroy Creiisa. The heat of Apulia in
the dog-days, of Hercules’ fiery garmeni, was nothing to it. If Maecenas has the
bad laste to have such a dish again, may he be rewarded by finding that he cannot
get a kiss if he wishes it.'

Compare the commencement of Od. 2. 13.
