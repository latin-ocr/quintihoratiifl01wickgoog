O D E XXXIII.

‘Turius not too much, Albius, of Glycera's faithlessness, nor write piteous elegies
about your rejection. It is the way always. LycorIs pining ior Cyrus: Cyrus iu
love with Pholo'e‘, who will as soon wed him asa she goat a woll. This is merely
Venus’ cruel spart. Iam aot exempt from the law?

The Ode is addressed to Albius Tibullus, the poet, to whom also Horace wrote
an Epistle (1. 4). Glycera is not one ol the mistresses to whom any of Tibullus'
extant poems are addressed. See Dean Milman’s Article on Tibullus in the Dict.

ALBI, ue doleas plus nlmio memor
Immitis Glycerae, neu miserabiles
Decantes elegos cur tibi iunidr
Laesa praeniteat fide 3
Insignem tenui fronte Lycorida ,
Cyri torret amor, Cyrus in asperam

1. na doleas, ‘to prevent your griev-
ing, consider these laets! Itis not a
direct prohibition, but the negative
purpose ol the coming recital. Cp. 2. 1.
37 and 4. 9. 1.

plus nimio, see on Od. 1. 18.15. It
seems to quality ‘doleas' as well as
'memou’

2. immitis Glycerae, with a play
on her name which makes it au oxy·
moron; πικρὸν Γλυκέριονι see on Od.
1. aaa .

mtsaiabr'las, ‘piteous’ ‘moving plty.’
Virg. G. 4. 514, oi the nightiugale,
‘miserabile carmen Integrat.’

3. decantas. From the notion oi
‘singing out to the end,’ comes that oi

' persisteres, and theu of the tedionsness

of repetitIon, the same tune always, in
which sense the verb is used constantly
in Cicero, as de Or. 2. 18. 75 ‘nec mihi
opus est Graeco aliquo doctore qui mihi
pervulgata praecepta decantet.’ Cp.
Epp. 1. 1. 64 ‘naenia . . Curiis et decan-
tata Camillis?

our . . praeniteat, this is thequestion
which he is perpetually asking in his
piteous elegias. Cp. Epp. r. 8. 10
‘irascar amicis Cur me funesto pro·
petent arcere veterno,’ ‘be angry‚ and
ask what they mean by warning me,' etc.

So in prose, Cic. ad Att. 3. 9 ‘quod me
accusas, cur hunc meum casum tam
graviter feram, debes ignoscere!

5 soll. Cp. the sixtlr Idyll of Mo·
schus, Ἥρα Πὰν ’Agris rtis γείτονος ἤρατο
δ’ ’Axia σκιρτητᾶ Sarapa, Σάτυροε δ’
ἔπεμαίνετο Arida, κ.τ.λ.

5. tenuifroute. Mart. 4.42.9‘irons
brevis.³ Cp. Epp. 1. 7. 26 ‘reddes ..
nigros angusta fronte capillos’ It Is a
mark there os youth as well as of good
looks, and. seems to* suggest that this

admiration for a low lorehead‚ or rather v

for hair low down ou the forehead. was
connected with the horror which a
Roman felt for baldness.

6. torret. The metaphoris Sappho's,
durare ἄμμε Fr. 115.

cyrus . . Pholoen, see App. 1. The
name of ‘Cyrus’ appears iu Od. 1. 17.
25, that of ‘Pholoe fugax' in Od. a.
5. 17. In both cases the type of cha·
racter. if not the person indicated, is
the same as in this place. ‘Pholoe’
is the name of a coy or coquettish girl
in Tibull. 1. 8.

tnasparam declinat. ‘Asperam'is
not a mere epithet‚ but predicative.
Cyrus, instead of pursuing Lycoris turns ·
asida aster Pholoe, but only to find her
bristles set against him.
