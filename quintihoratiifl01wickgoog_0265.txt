HORATII CARMINUM

Nam quae nivali pascitur Algido
Devota quercus inter et ilices
Aut crescit Albanis in herbis
¹ Victima pontificum secures
Cervice tinget: te nihil attinet
Tentare multa caede bidentium

Parvos coronantem marino
Rore deos fragilique myrto,
immunis aram si tetigit manus,
Non sumptuosa blandior hostia

9. pasoitur, ‘is even now seedi'ug?

Algidor see on 1. ar. 6, where
‘gelido’ is possibly the same as ‘nivali '
here. Cp. 4. 4. 57.

10. devota, already destined ’ for
sacrifice. Cp. Virg. G. 5. 157, where
the destination of the different calves
is settled immediately on their birth:
‘Aut aris servare sacros aut scindere
terram!

12. pontificum, i. e. at public sa·
crifices; opposed to simpler home
rites.

13. nihil attinet, οὐδὲν προσήκει,
‘there is no need!

14. tentare, as it were ‘to lay siege
to’ their goodwlll. Cp. A. P. 405
‘gratia regum Pieriis tentata modis‚'
and Virgil's ‘animam tentare precando‚’
Aen. 4. 113. ‘Deos’ is constructed ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ (see on 1. 3. 6) aiter ‘tentare’
and ‘coronantem ’ς ‘parvos’ is properly
an epithet of the images not of the gods
themselves, and therefore belongs to
‘Deos' as the object os ‘coronantem'
rather than as the object os ‘tentare'
(see on a.5. 13); at the sometime it is
antithetieal to ‘multa eaede,’ so that it
cannot be severed from ‘tentare’ but
serves rather as a link between the two
clauses, as though he said ‘your very
gods are small (i. e. in their representa-

· tive images): adapt your offerings to

them.‘

15. parvos, as Tibull. 1. c. ‘exigua
ligneus aede deus? Cp. with all this
Juv. 12. 87, 88.

marino rore, rosemary.

16. fragili, ‘easily pluelred' a sprig of
myrtle, opposed to more elaborate and
expensive garlanda so ‘simplex myrtus'
(1. 38. 5) opposed to ‘nexae philyra
coronae?

17.2o.‘Though thy hand when it

was laid on the altar held no gift, it has
sostened the displeasure ol the Penates
with the pious oilering of meal and
crackling salt, and could please no more
with [i. e. if it brought] a costly vistim!
‘Si '=‘ etiam si' ; ‘non blandior ' = ‘ non
blandior iutura‚’ ‘non gratior iis futura
per sumptuosam hostiam? Lambin.
The Scholiasts Aer. and Porph. make
‘immunis’=⁴irnrnunis scelerum‚’ the
sentiment being then general, not spe·
cial to Phidyle: ‘if the hand that is
laid on the altar be exempt from crime,
ir sustensi etc„ and the majority os edi-
tors lollow them. The common mean-
ing os ‘immunis’ is ‘exempted from
some public duty or tar! It was used
metaphorically, but with a genitive case
oi that from which exemption was
claimed: Virg. Aen 12. 559 ‘immunem
belli: and, to corne nearer to the present
case, Ov. Her. 14. 8 ‘immunes caerlis
habere manus' But it is hard to see
how‘immuois’ could have meant ‘peace-
ful’ in Virgil or ‘pure from blood’ in
ovid, if the genitivos had been omitted.
On the other hand, Horace uses the adj,
in two other passages (od. 4. 12. 25
‘non ego te meis Immunem meditor
tingere poculis,' aud Epp. 1,14. 33 ‘im-
munem Cinarae placuisse rapaei’) in the
sense of ‘without gifts‚' adapting the
word, aster his fashion‚ to the Greek
atropos. Orelli, giving up the theory of
an ellipsis, tries, not very sueoesssully,
to bring the word round to the Scho-
liasts' meaning of ‘guiltless’ by explain·
ing it ‘quae nihil praestare debet‚’
‘which owes no gin: ie. which brings
what it brings freely‚ not as a due to
expiate any crime. But the whole at-
tempt to force this meaning on ‘im-
munis’ seems to be founded on a mis-
eonceptiou of the staura. The moral
