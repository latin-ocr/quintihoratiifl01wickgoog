O DE XXIII.

‘Pnnr duIy at the new mo'ons, O country housewise, and offer to the Lares frankr
incense and com and a porker, and your wines and your erops' and your flocks
shall be kept saie· Costly sacrifices are sor the “ pontifices.” Put your garlands of
rosemary and myrtle on the little imag-es of your gods and 'there is no need for
more. Without any gifts but'the salted cake you may win their favour, as much

as by a sumptuous viatim! Ἴ

‘The gods accept the humble offerings ol humble people. Moderation‚ slmpli- Ἴ
city, thrift, content with ,our own station, have place in religions observante as
well as in other phases oI life! This is all the doctrine of the Ode. The name
Phidyle (Gr. fem. os Φειδύλοε) is clearly chosen to characterise a ‘thrifty’ Sabine

housewlle.

⁵CAELO supInas si tuleris manus
Nascente Luna, rustica Phidyle,
Si thure placaris et horna
Fruge Lares aridaque porca,
N ec pestilentem sentiet Africum
Fecunda uitis nec sterilem seges
RobIginem aut dulces alumni
Pomifero grave tempus anno,

1. eaelo=‘ad caelum’; ι it eaelo
clamor,’ Virg. Aen. 5. 451.

supinas, ὑπτιάσμασιν χερῶν, Aesch.
P. V. 1005, Virg. Aen. 3. 176 ‘tendo-
que supinas Ad caelum cum voce manus.'
The hands were held open with the
palms upward. ‘Supinas ferre manus’
might ὒθ--χεΐρασ ἀνασχεῖν, and be a
common way of sayIng ‘to pray': pos·
sibly, in combination with the other
particulam, ‘nascente Lnna,' ‘thura’
‘horna Iruge,' etc. it helps the idea os
punctual ritual performance.

2. nascente Luna, on the first of the
month; see on 3. 19. 9, Cato de R. R.
143 ‘Kalendis . . eoronam in Iocum in·
dat; per eosdemque dies Lari familiari
pro copia supplicet! Cp. Tibull. 1. 5.
34 ‘Reddereque antiquo menstrua thura
LarI‚’ and read the same poet. 1. 10.

15-28, where many expressions of this
Ode find a parallel.

3. horna fruge, the firstsruits os the
year’s com ς, ‘ spicea serta? Tibull. l. c.
4· porea, ‘Hostia erit plena rustica

'porcus hara’ ib„ ‘immolet aequis Hic

porcum Laribus,’ Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 165.
Why ‘ avida'? Ovio, speaking of sacri·
ficmg a pig to Ceres (Fast. 1. 349),
makes its greediness the ground os its
fate: ‘Nam sata rere novo teneris lac-
tentia suceis Eruta setigerae comperit
ore suis? But the pig does not offend
the Lares in this way. The epithet is
intended probably to help the feeling os
the familiarity oi the object, and so the
simplieity os the offering.

7. alumn13 see on 3. 18. 4.

8. grove tempus, ‘the sickly time
when the year bears its fruits.' For the
ablatIve see 2. 7. 16 ‘iretis aestuosis.¹
With ‘pomifero anno* cp. ‘ annus hiber-
nus‚' Epod. 2. 293 sor the sickliness of
autumn cp. Od. ν. 14. 15, Sat. 2. 6. 19⁴
