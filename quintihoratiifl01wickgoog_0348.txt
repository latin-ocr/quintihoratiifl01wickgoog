CARMEN SECULARE.

m

Anouo the antiquarian and religious resvivals of Augustus, Suetonius

η (Aug. 31) mentions the ‘Ludi Seculares'3 Dio (54. 18) fixes the date

to the consulship ol C. Furnius and C. Silanae, nc. 17, but beyond

Ἴ this and the lact that it professed to be their fifth celebration‚ he tells

¹ us nothing. No fult account of them is found earlier than Censorinus

(de Die Natali, c. 5 ‘de Seculo')‚ the writer on astrology in the

second baliol the 3rd century, who is supplemented by Zosimus
(a. 5), the hist-orion, in the middle ol the 5th century. '

Tacitus (Anu. 11. 11) mentions their repetition in the reign ol
Claudius, nu. 46, but declines to describe them, on the ground that
he has already given in the Histories (in one of the Books now lost)
a particular account of their celebration under Domitian, on which
occasion be had had the fullest cognizance of their details, as being
himself one of the ‘quindecimviri' and- a praetor.

The games ol which they professed to be the revival went under
the Republic by the name oi Tarentini (or Tarentini) and Taurii, the
former name being connected by all writers with the ‘stagna Tarenti'
or ‘Terenti’ a spot at the north edge of the Campus Martius, near
the river, once a suamp, and probably a warin spring (see Burn's
Rome and the Campagna, p. 300), the locality of some ol the cere·
monies even in Augustus' celebration 3 the latter variously derived-
by Servius (on Virg. Aen. a. 140), from the ‘taurese' or sterile cows
which were sacrificed.

Their origin according to some ol the authorities according to
others their second celebration‚ uras ascribed to Val. Publicola. All
