Ir is hardly necessary to read nsue’s 'summary of the many and
mutually destructive theories that have been proposed in order to
perceive the iutility of attempting to construet out of the Pyrrhas,
LalageS, Lydios of the Odes a history oi Horace's loves and dis·-
, appointrnents Whatever foundation any Ode may have had in the
feelings or facts of the moment it is impossible now to distinguish
shadow from substance ; and there is much to indicate that Horace
did not wish it to be otherwise. Wthtever be their origin, he treats
his love Odes as artistic studies. He arranges them not, we can feel
sure, in any'chronological order as remembrances of his own life,
but where they will be most useful to relieve more serious poenis
or to stand side by side as companion pictures We may see as
much as this from the nature of the names which he employs.
A certain number owe their selection obviously to their etymological
meaning, such as Pyrrha in 1. 5, Chloe in 2. 23, Lyce in 3. 20, Phi-
dyle in 3. 23 (cp. Sybaris in 1. 83 the list may possibly be extended
by the names 01 Lalage in 1. 22, Leuconoe in 1. 11, and of Telephus
r. 23, etc. Horace is fond of playiug on the meaning of 2220222,
‘Glycerae immitis,' 1. 33. 2, ‘Bibuli consulis amphoram,' 3. 28, 8,
‘Dulci Lyaeo solvere,’ Epod. 9. 38). -Sorne rnore are suspiciously
well adopted to the mette oi the special poem 3 Leuconoe has this
reason at any rate for her existence, so has ‘Asterie' in 3. 7, and
‘Neobule' (cp. the name oi her lover, ‘Liparaeus Hebrus') in the
ionic a minore metre ol 3. 12. With one or two exceptions the
unknown male names in the Odes (the names of Horace’s rivale,
asin 1. 23, on any theory of a real Lydia) are Greek names, Tele·

, phus, GygeS, Calais3 mythological names; sometimes the narnes of

Greek rivers, Hebrus 3. 12, Enipeus 3. 7. We may add perhaps
that where the designation is most full and precise we seem to see
most definitely the purpose of giving momentary substance to an
acknowledgedshadow; see on ‘Thurini Calais filius Ornyti' 3.9. 14, ani
cp. introd. to 2. 4. In a few cases we seem to see the appropriation
