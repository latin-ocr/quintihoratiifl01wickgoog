LIB. III.

O quisquis volet impias

OD. 24. ·

Caedes et rabiem tollere civicam,
¹ Si quaeret PATER unarum
Subscribi statuis, indomitam audeat

Refrenare licentiam,

Clarus postgenitis: quatenus—heu nefas l-
Virtutem incolumem odimus,

Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi. ¹
Quid tristes querimoniae, ’

Si non supplicio culpa reciditur,

Quid leges sine moribus

Vanae proficiunt, si neque fervidis

Pars inclusa caloribus

Mundi nec Boreae finitimum latus

Durataeque solo nives

i

Mercatorem abigunt, horrida callidi 40

they dare not sin,' etc.; but the Latin is
awkward.

pretium, ποινή. The word does not
necessarily imply either reward or
punishment. Juv. Sat. 13, 105 ‘Ille
crucem sceleris pretium tulit, hie dia·
dema’

25. It appears from Porph. that in
his time some copies marked the be«
ginning of a new Ode here, for he con-
demns such a division. See on Od.
1. 7. 15 and Epod. 2. 23.

26. oivioam, ‘of citizens against citi·
zens' See on 1. 2. 21 ‘audiet cives
acuisse ferrum’

27. Pater urbium. Itis impossible
to doubt that Horace had in mind the
historic title of great patriotS, ‘Pater
Patriae,' which, though it had not yet
been conferred on Augustus by the
Senate. may yet have been currently
given to him by his partisans (see on
1. a. 5o); but the form ‘Pater urbium’
is taken rather from the more special
designations given to their benefactore
hy particular towns. Orelli quotes an
inscription to Augustus from Jadera,a
colony in illyria, nun cassan. nrvr r,
aue. rannus cononum nurum nr nunnus
nunu. Cicero bids his brother (ad
Q. Fr. 1. 1) deserve the title of ⁸ parens
Asiae.’ This general benefactor is to
he recognised as such from city to city,
to have in each 'his statue with the
memorial of his public services.

28. subscribi, i. e. to have his name
inscribed at the bottom of the statues.

29. remanare licentiam, cp. 4. 15. 9
where Horace proclaims that Augustus
has accomplished this task, ‘ordinem
Rectum evaganti frena licentiaeIniecit.’

30. quatenus, ‘since' Sat. 1. 1. 64,
ν. 3. 76, Juv. 12. 102 ; not found before
Horace.

31, 32. For the sentiment cp. 2. 1. 10-
14, and the verses attributed to Menan-
der: Δεινοῒγὰράνδρῖ πάντες ἐσμὲν enarret
Ζῶντι φθονῆσαι κατθανόντα δ’ αἰνέσαι.

52. quaerimus, ποθοῦμεν, ‘requiri-
mus' ‘we look for without finding?

invidi goes with both clauses; it is
the clue to the apparent inconsistency.

33. querimoniae, lamentations in
the senate, in society, in literature, over
the evils of the time.

35. leges sine moribus, cp. 4. 5. 22,
where Augustus is represented as hav-
ing touched both springs of reformation:
‘Mos et lex maculosum edomuit nefas!

5538. pars,1atus; cp. 3. 3. 55 ‘Qua
parte debacchentur ignes'3 1. 22. 19
‘Quod latus mundi nebulae malusque
luppiter urget)

37. inclusa, ‘fenced inf as if the
heats were intended to bar it from
human intrusion. ‘Terra domibus ne·
gata‚’ ibid. Virg. Aen. 7. 227 ‘si quem
. . dirimit plaga solis iniqui!

39. solo, ablative of place.
