ODE ill.

‘O surr, in which Virgil is sailing to Greece, carry thy precious burden safely.
It is a dreadful risk, the sea. He was a hard, bold man who¹ first ventured upon
it. The gods meant it to be a barrier impassable‚ but man delights in disobe-
dience. Prometheus brought fire on earth and sickness with it. Daedalus tried
to fly. Acheron was no bertier to Hercules. Where shall we stop? and when
will Jove be able to lay aside his bolts of wrathl' ’ .

This Ode has been very generally referred to the voyage ofyirgil to Athens, Ἴ
from which he returned only to die in uo. 19. This. however, would fix its corn·
position four years later than the date which the considerations suggestion by Od.
1. 12 lead us to assign to the publication of Books i-iii; nor is it an Ode which
seems very likely to have been inserted after publication, Given to the world in
Virgil's lifetime, it seems playful and affectionate, but it would seem cold and
irrelevant to be published after his early death, and in a volumein which it was
the sole record of their friendship. Franke felt the difficulty so much that he pro-
posed to read ‘ Quintilium' for ‘Virgilium' thinking that he could trace a corre-
spondence between this Ode and 1. 24, especially in v. 11 ‘heu non ita credhunu'
It has even been suggested that it may have been auotlfer Virgilius, as is the case
probably with Od. 4. 12. The simplest solution would be that the reference is to
another voyage. All we know even of the voyage iu nc. 19 is due to the frag·
mentary biography which goes by the name of Donatus,and which is not supposed
to be earlier than the fifth century.

For other notices of Horace’s friendship for virgil, cp. Sat. 1. 5. 40 ; 6. 55. The
form of the Ode may have been suggested by a poem of Callimachus,the beginning
oi which is preserved :-

ἂναῦε ἃ τὸ μόνον φέγγος ἐμὸν rd γλυκὺ rtis §ode

ἅρπαξαε, ποτί τυ Ζᾶνοε inveniunt λιμενοσκόπω.
Statius' ‘Propempticon Metio Celeri‚' Sylv. 3. 2, is in great part an expansion of
Horace's poem. We may contrast Horace's wishes for the voyage of an enemy,
Epod. [ο. ·

The tirade against sea-travelling as one form of man’s restless audacity is in part
playful; and as Prof. Sellar (Roman Poets of the Augustan Age, p. 120) suggests,
adapted to Virgil's own temperament and expressed feelings: ,but Horace recurs
to the idea that commerce and the mingling of nations are against nature and
a source of evil, and that if the golden age could 'return they would cease;
