82 HORATII CARMINUM

the shore near Tarentum. llhich is most likely, that a speaker on the shore es

Apulia should commend a passing sailor to the care of ‘Neptune the warder of

'sacred Tarentum' or that one speaking at Tarentum shall apostrophize Archytas

in his burial place on the ‘litus Matinum'l The question seems to be really

settled by the second local reference in v. 26. The woods about Venusia are near

enough to stand for the 'inland woods’ on the shore just north of the Aufidus, but
· they would not occur naturally if the scene were at Tarentum. ,

The Ode consists of at least two parts; some moralizing on the universality of
Death, connected in some way with the fate of Archytas, and the petition of an
unbnried corpse for the handful of saud which would enable it to cross the Styx.
What is the relation between the two? The oldest answer was that the unbnried
body was that of Archytas himself, who (we must suppose) had been drowned and
cast ashore during avoyage on the Adriatic. The Scholiasts consider the Odea
monologue, the shade of Archytas addressing itself in the first twenty lines, and
appealing to a passing sailor in the remainder. The commoner view makes ita
dialogue begun by the sailor who finds the body of the philosopher, and moralizes
upon it till heis interrupted by the shade of Archytas. Where the break takes
place is a question still to be settled. Verses 7, 15, r7, and 21, have all been pro·
posed. A chief motive for throwing the division as late at least as v. 15, is to
prevent the appeal of v. 14 ‘ Iudice te non sordidus auctor Naturae verique' from
being addressed by Archytas to the sailor. Newman‚ on the contrary, hears in
the appeal so addressed a very keynote of the Ode. He thinks that ‘ the poem is
written in the spirit oi Lucian to ridicule the mixture of old mythology aud new
philosophy in Seuthem Italy, where the Pythagoreau doctrines were widely dif-
fused. The sailor is presumed, hy the shade of Archytas, to be au adherent os
Pythagoras? ,

Dillenburger, dividing at v. 17,thinks that the point of the Ode is the mutual
exposure by a philosopher and a man of the world of the vanity of their respec-
tive pursuits,-the philosopher measuring the saud and dreaming of metem-
psychosis, the trader so intent on his pursuit of gain as to be unwilling to sparea
minute to render the last service to his brother marn—both losing sight of death,
and of their· common humanity. The chief difficulty in the way of this interpre-
tation is supposed to lie in the rendering of vv. 2, 3. Can ‘parva munera pulveris
te cohibent' mean ‘the want of the gift of a little dustykeeps you fast'l Orbas
Horace, when be makes Archytas ask for burial in v. 23, sorgotten that be had
already buried him in v. a? Perhaps we rnay say that neither Horace nor
Archytas vouch for the fact of a dne sprinkling of dust. They are the sailor’s
words; and heis thinking at the time of the small compass to which the far·
reaching mind of the philosopher is shrunk, not ot the sufficiency or insufficiency
of his burial. Archytas replies that his caseis worse even than the sailor had
supposed, for he still lacks the saud that would give his shade rest.

These interpretem who, sor this or other reasons, hold that the unbnried body is
of some other than Archytas, explain the address of the early lines by placing the
scene of the Ode in sight of Archytas' tomb. There is still a question whether it
is a dialogue or a monologue. 'l'he interpretation which Orelli gives from an
anonyrnous friend, and which he favours himself, makes the contrast between
vv. 1-20, which contain reflectious on the common doom of mortality suggested
to a passing voyager by the sight os the philosopher's tomb, and the remainder of
the Ode, in which the voice of an unbnried corpse on the shore is supposed to
interrupt his moralizing, aad in its urgent appeal to suggest that, after all, death is
not the hardest of lates.

Ritter imagines the Ode to have been suggested by the drowning of some
