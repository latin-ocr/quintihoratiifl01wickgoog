HORATH EPODON

Cales venenis officina Colchicis, ‘
Quae finis aut quod me manet stipendium?
Effare3 iussas curn fide poenas luam,

Ἴ Paratus expiere, seu poposceris
Centum iuvencos, sive mendaci lyra
Voles sonari: Tu pudica, tu proha
Perambulabis astra sidus aureum.
infamis Helenae Castor offensus vice
Fraterque magni Castoris, victi prece,
Adempta vati reddidere lumina.
Et tu, potes nam, solve me dementia,
O nec paternis obsoleta sordibus,
Neque in sepulcris pauperum prudens anus
Nouendiales dissipare pulveres.

Ant. 960, possibly, as Bentley suggested,

. with a reminiscente of Lucretius⁷ ‘ilam-

mai flore,’ 1. 898. Orelli takes it ol
the green, sulphurous ilame of a vol·
cano; but it does not appear that the
fire of Aetna has any colour which
would justisy such an epithet. or that
the ancients attributed any such colour
to it. There is a variety of reading
among the later MSS, the i in ‘virens'
being scratched by a later hand in three,
‘urens ' being found in several, ‘furens'
which Bentley preferred, in a few.

35 onies. The boldness ot the me·
raphon attracted the notice ol Porph:
‘ipsam mulierem officinam venenorum
diserte duit: Canidia is a laboratory
of magic drugs, in which the lires will
not slaclcen till Horace is bnmt to ashes,
which the wind can carry about and
make sport os.

36. stipendium, ‘composition' ‘pay-
ment in lieu of punishment) ‘When
will the end corne, or how can lbuy
mysels oft’? Cp. Catuli. 64. 173. os
the human tribute exacted by the Mino·
taur. ‘dira ferens stipendia tauro.' lt is
not uncommonly used of a tribute
imposcd on a conquered country; ‘sti-
pendio multare.' Cic. pro Balb. 18.

39. mendaci lyra, parallel to v. 20.
He must lie to praise her, but he will
lie if she pleases. Orelli thinks that it
is an equivoque, and that she might
have taken ‘mendaci' to mean ‘which
lied before in reviling you'3 but the
other· meaning os the words would have
been the more obvious of the two. The

humour consiste, not in any by·play
which Canidia is supposed to miss, but
in the offering as a palinode a lampoon
inore hitter than that which it professes
to retract.

42. infamis=⁴ infamatae’ sc. ‘a Ste-
{iplhoro’6 For the story see Introd. to

.1.1 .

vioe, ‘on behalf of? Orelli and .
Ditis. follow Bentley in preferring
‘vicem' the reading which is found iu
two MSS. of no great age3 the con·
struction, then, as in Plaut. Rud. 3. 5.
34 ‘llos respondetote istinc istarum
vicem.

46. obsoleta; cp.(with Orelli) ‘Virtus
.. neque alienis sordibus obsolescit,’
Cic. pro Sest. 28; ‘of tattered reputation
from the meanness of your parentage.'
Horace uses it elsewhere oia tumble·
down house; Od. a. 10. 6.

47. prudens ‘well settled) It is per-
haps with special reference to the em·
phatic ‘pauperum' as the Scholiast
suggests; she shows her wisdom in
choosing graves that were not guarded.

48. novendiales, ‘ninthday ashes'
seem to mean *fresh buried.' These
were held fitter for a wizards purpose;
cp. Ov. Her. 6. 90 ‘certaque de tepidis
colligit ossa rogis'etc. The adjective
‘novendialis’ properly means ‘continu-
ing for nine days'3 and this is the com·
mon meaning of ‘novendiale sacrum?
‘novendiales feriae,' etc. But i scenis
also to have been used of the special
ceremonies which, at Rome as well as
in Greece, took place on the ninth day
