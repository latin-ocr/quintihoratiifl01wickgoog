Sidera, nunc hiemes iniquas, Ἴ
Contracta pisces aequora sentiunt Ἴ
Iactis in altum molibus; huc frequens

as. Haedi, Virg. Aen. 9. 668 ‘Quan-
tus ab occasu veniens pluvialibus Haedis
Verberat imber humum.⁸

Ἴ 29-32. Cp. Epp. r. 8. 5 foll. ‘Haud ι

quia grando Contuderit vites oleamque
momorderit aestus‚¹ etc. The farm has
broken its promise of yield (ep. Epp. 1.
7, 87 ‘spem mentita seges‚’ and contrast
Od. 3. 16. 30 ‘segetis certa fides')‚ and
the fruit-trees are represented as always
able (⁴uunc‚’ ‘nuno’ ‘nunc’) to excuse
themselves, and throw the blame on the
westher.

32· sidera, the heat attributed to the
Dogstar. Epod. 16. 61 ‘nullius astri
Gregem aestuosa torret impotentia?

33. eontractapisoesetc. Variously

taken of the ‘piscinae marinae' in which
the fish find themselves inclosed‚ and of
the sea at large, which is represented as
narrowed by the number of villas built
into it. The latter is more probable,
and the hyperbole is not greater than 3.

, 34. laetis molibus; cp. the descrip-
tion ol the processio Virg. Aen. 9.
710 foll. ‘Qualis in Euboico Cumarum
litore quondam Saxea pila cadit, magnis
quam molibus ante Constructam pelago
iaciunt,’ etc.

huo, into the space inclosed by the
messes of masonry that have been let
down into the water.

Horace represents the builder (⁶ re·

(⁸ frequens’), thf servants of the owner
(¹ famulis ⁵), and the owner himself, as
all engaged in hurrying on the work.

36. terrae fastidiosus, like ‘parum

cept that here it is the sense of weari-
ness‚ there of greed‚ that is prominent.

37. Minae, the forebodings ol his
own imagination.

38. scandunt, they can clamber into
the villa built out in the water. by the
same entrance as the master.

neque decedit, ete, the marine villa
is lost in the general idea of the impos·
sibility of flying from care. With the
whole stanaa cp.a.16. at foll. and see
note there, The reminiscente of Lu·
cretius (a. 47 foll.) is more evident in
this place than in that. ‘Timor et
Minae’ recalls ‘metus hominum, curae·
que* sequaces‚'·and in the following
staura we may hear the echo of ‘neque
fulgorem reverentur ab auro, Nec clar
rum vestis splendorem purpurari.¹

41. quodsi, etc. The application of
the moral professedly to himself, really
to those whose desires are not as mode·
rate. ¹

dolentem, in body or mind. Cp.
Epp. 1. a. 46 foll. ‘Quod satis est cui
contingit nilril amplius optet. Non
domus et fundus non aeris acervus et

febres Nou animo curas?

Phrygius lapis, a famous marble,
white with red spots, brought from
{ypnada in Phrygia. Cp. esp. Stat.
