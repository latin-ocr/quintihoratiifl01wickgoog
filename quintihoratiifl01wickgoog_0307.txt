HORATH CARMINUM

ODE IV.

‘Ltus a young engle that leaves the nest, tries his wings, then swoops down,
first on sheep-folda but soon on more dangerous foes3—like a young lion to the

eyes of the unsuspectinghind, who is to be the first victim of his unfleshed tooth ;—
such has Drusus been in his campaign in Vindelicia-noble by inherited excellence,
noble also by his royal rearing. Rome's gratitude to the house of the Neros is
summed up in the memory of Metaurus, the turning-point of the terrible Punic war,
when Hasdrubal was routed, and the traces of war vanished, and Hannibal himself
bore witness to Rome's vitality. ‘¹ It is madness for us to pnrsue our enemy; more
than enough if we can escape their pursuit. From the fires of their native Troy,
from the hardships of the long voyage to Italy, they bave but drawn strength and
stubbomness‚ like the oak on Algidus which the woodman laps, or the hydra ever
growing again io baille the patience of Hercules, All hope is gone for ever, and
buried with Hasdrubal.” And the conqueror was an ancestor of the Neros.
Jupiter protecte the race, and Augustus directs their campaigns. What may we not
expect from their arms‘i’

Nero Claudius Drusus the younger of the two sons of Livia Drusilla, by her
first husband, Tiberius Claudius N ero, was born in Augustus’ house, rac. 38, three
months after his mother’s divorse and renrnrriage. He was byfar the most popular
of the two brothers. ln ac. 16, when Augustus set out for Gaul, taking with him
Tiberius, who was praetor at the time, Drusus was appointed to discharge the
duties of the office during his brother's absence (Dio 54. 19). Of his expedition
in the following year against the Raeti, some account will be found in the Introd.
to this Book. He died, six years afterwards, from the effect of a fall from his
horse, while engaged in the last of three campaigns beyond the Rhine, which
gained for him the posthumous title of Germanicus.
