xviii INTRODUCTION.

(e. g. ‘videri' against the metra in Epod. 16. 14), little or no pr00f

of alteration on rhetorical or general grounds. ln this class Holder
places, of the MSS. named above, A, α (in respect of most readings),
D, y, and, though not on an equality with these, τ.

’ The second class is supposed to show the corrections of an early
and intelligent emender. That such διορθωταί existed in early times is
stated by the Pseudo-Acron on Ars Poet. 345. And the name of
one is found in the inscription which appears in slightly different
terrm, at the end of the Epodes in l, l, Reg., g. ‘Vettius Agorius
Basilius Mavortius V. C. et inl. (vir clarissimus et inlustris) Excom.
Dom. excons. ord. (Excomite Domestico, exconsule ordinario) legi et
ut potui emendavi, conferente mihi magistro Felice oratore urbis
Romae! Felix is not known, but Mavortius was consul in the year
an. 527. Asterius, consul 494, is similarly connected with the his-
tory of the text of Virgil. Bentley had treated this Mavortiam recen-
sion as the ultimate point to which the oldest MSS. might be expected
to take us back. Holder treats it rather as the first, though not the
worst, source of systematic corruption. ln the class which he thinks
owe their peculiarities to this editing, he places B, V, with g, and in
respect of some of their readings, A, a, and λ, the first two of these
being ln respect of much of their text affiliated to class one, the third
to class three.

The third class (in which rank F (=pyr)‚ λ’ <=ll), u, rr, σ, and
others) is held to be of less value, both as having been derived, in Ι
’ the first instance, from more faulty originab, and as bearing signs
of later and less intelligent correction.

These conclusione are based upon such an elaborate study of the
MSS. that it is impossible to criticise them in the absence of the full
explanation and detailed evidence which are still promised. But it
may be observed that the tie which is imagined between the MSS.
which are classed together is confessedlya loose one. Room is left
for considerable influence of MSS. of one class upon those of another.
As a fact, there are very few cases indeed of doubtful reading where
the division of testimony corresponds at all exactly to the three classes.
Doubtless there are a few crucial passages where the value which is
set on such MSS. as V'or B goes far to decide the choice of a reading,
and there must be more cases still where the instinctive feeling of the
trustworthiness of particular lllSS. on ¹particular points which comes
from long intercourse with them, but which no ‘ apparatus criticus' will
convey to areader, has guided Keller or Holder to a conclusion which
the mere inspection of the list' of llllSS. on one side and the other
