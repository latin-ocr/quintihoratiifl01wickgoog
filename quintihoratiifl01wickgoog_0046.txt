ODE I.

‘Merrhave different ideas of glory and happiness-success in the 9lympic garnes,
civic honours, wealth. The farmer will not turn trader for any prospect of richer,
nor the trader· give up the sea for any danger. One likes o life of ease; another
the excitemems of war or sport. My taste is lyric poetry‚ and my glory that you
⁸ should rank me with the lyric poets of Greece'

The Ode is clearly written as an introduction. (Cp. the tone of Od. 3. 30, when
the work is done.) It is dedicated to Maecenas-as is the first of the Epodes, the
first of the Satires, the first 01 B. i. of the Epistles. See Introd. to Books i-iii. 5 11. 2.

Compare also Od. 4. 3, which recalls the main thoughts 01 this Ode, though its
confident tone and the absence of a patron’s name point tyre change which had by
that time corne upon the poet's circumstances. There is no need in either Ode to
trace the ‘incongruous’ mention of the Olympio games as among the natural
objects of ambition to the remembranee of any special Greek original, such as
Pind. Fr. 201 :- ’

ἀελλοπόδων μέν τιν’ εὐφραίνωσιν ἵππιον
τίμια rrul στέφανοι roris δ’ ἓν πολυχρύσου θαλάμοις βιοτά, ιι. ιλ.

The purpose is to give the feeling of a wide surrey of human lise, and Horace does
not draw a strong line between the Greek life which survived in literature and the
actual Roman life os his own day. The apology for poetry‚ as one among the
various tastes 01 mankind, is as old at least as Solon (0. 43-30), and Horace would
remember the end 01 Virg. G. a, esp. vv. 503 foll. For the same thoughts in a less
poetical form, cp. Sat. a. 1. 24 1011. ‘Quot capitum vivunt totidem studiorum Millia:
me pedibus delectat claudere verba, etc?
