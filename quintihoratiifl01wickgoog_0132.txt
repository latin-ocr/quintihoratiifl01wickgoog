ODE XXXV.-

Tne Fortuna of this Ode, as hasbeen already suggestedis a different conception
from that of the last. She is the author oi the vicissitudes of life, but not ia sport
(as in Od. 3. 29. 49), or at raedam, as the blind chance-goddess.- The apparent
capriciousness is that of a hidden will, and its decisions have the fixity os sate.
Through any confusion of image in vv. 21-28 (see οη v. 24) the thought seems
clear, that her attributes are moral. ‘Her frown does not drive away hope nor
extinguish any but 'mercenary affection? Her purposcs' are moral, and the great·
ness oi Rome is amongst them. This gives their relevancy to the later stanzas.
‘The rule os Caesar is the cessationes civil bloodshed th restoration of religion,
the turning of Roman arms to their legitimate aim oie conquering 'the world.
Therejore Fortune is invoked to protect him and his pians!

One ni the chief conceptibus of Fortune to a Roman was the¹ ‘Fortuna
publica,’ ‘Fortuna populi Romani,' the Fortune described in Plutarch’s image
(de Fortuna Romanorum, c. 4): ‘even as Aphrodite, when she crossed the Eurotas,
laid aside her mirror aad her omaments and her cestus, and took spear and shield
to adorn herself for Lycurgus’ eyes, so when, after· her sojourning with Persians
and Assyriam, with Macedonians and Carthaginians she (τύχη) approached the
Palatine and crossed the Tiber, she laid aside her wings and took off ber sandals
aad leit behind her hall, the symbol oi fickleness and change!

O Diva, gratum quae regis Antium,
Praesens vel imo tollere de gradu ἵ
Mortale corpus vel superbos*
Vertere funeribus triumphos¹

1. gratum, sc. ‘tibi’ ‘your loved
Antium,’ as 'dilectam Cypron,' Od. 1.
30. a. Horace imitates the common
mode of addressing a Greek god or
goddess hythe title oi some chief seat
os their worship, ‘O qnae beatam diva
tenes Cyprum,' Od. 3. 26. 9, etc. There
was at Antium a famous temple of For·
tuna, or rather apparently ol the For·
tunae, who were represented as two
sistens, ‘veridicae sorores,' Mart. 5. 1. 3,
whose images were consulted as an
oracle; cp. Suet. Cal. 57.

a. praesens, not elsewhere used with

an infinitive, but found not uncomtnonly
in the sense of ponant: ‘ prompt to
any purpose.'

3. mortale eorpus, ‘ to litt from the
dust a frail morial alamand to change
to a funeral train the proud triumphal
procession.' ‘Mortale' corresponds to
‘funeribus’ ‘Put man at his lowest,
she can yet raise him to glory; put
him at his highest, a touch of her
haud brings him down to dust again.
‘Funeribus’ is the ablative, ‘vertere
seria ludo‚' A. P. 226, aster the analogy‘
of ‘mutare’ ,
