HORATII CARMINUM

Quae simul centum tetigit potentem
Oppidis Creten: Pater, o relictum
Filiae nomen, pietasque, dixit,
Victa furore!
Unde quo veni? Levis una mors est
Virginum culpae. Vigilansne ploro
Turpe commissum, an vitiis carentem
Ludit imago
Vana, quae porta fugiens eburna
Somnium ducit? Meliusne fluctus
Ire perlongus fuit, an recentes
Carpere flores?
Siquis infamem mihi nunc iuvencum
Dedat iratae, lacerare ferro et
Frangere enitar modo multum amati

¹ Cornua monstri.

33. centum oppidis, Epod. 9. 19.
The Homeris ἑκατόμπολιν, Il. 2. 649.

34. Pater, orelictum filiae nomen,
‘My father! oh name thy daughter
may 110 longer speak’ It is probably
best to take the words ‘Patert o nornen
(sc. patris) filiae (sc. afilia) relictum?
She calls on her father, but the name
reminds her that she has left behind her
the privileges as well as the duties re-
called by it. Bentley compares Ariadne's
confession, Ov. Her. ro. 69 ‘Nam pater
et tellus iusto regnata parenti Prodita
sunt facto uomina carameo? The other
possible construction, ‘filiae (gen. case)
nomen relictum (so a me)‚' seems, as
Bentley argues, to require ‘O paterl Ο
relictum' etc„ as they then become
separate exclamations.

Europa's father was, according to
Homer, Il. 14. 321, Phoenim according
to Ovid, Met. l. c., Agenor.

35. pietas vieta furore3 cp. Ov.
Met. 1. 149 ‘Victa iacet pietas? This
is better than with Acron, to take
‘ricta furore’ with ‘dixit’ as a descrip-
tion ol Europa.

37. unde quo. The two questions
run together after the Greek lashlon.
ris πόθεν yryr1u3 Eur. Alc. 215. ‘Asyn
deton convenit commoto loquentis
anim0‚’ Ritter. Mitsch. compares Vir-
gil’s expression 01 Turnus’ bewilder-
ment, Aen. 10. 669 ‘Quo feror? unde
abii? quae me fuga quemve reducetf'
This is perhaps consistent with the feel·

ing that if she answered her questions,
the answer would be, ‘from a happy
horne to shame and danger'3 but in the
first instance the picture seems to be 01
bewilderment, expressed by a rapid suc·
cessionoi contradictorythoughts, though
theysettledownatlastintoselfreproach.

11111 mors, ‘ a single death'=death
byitself,without additional paim. Soph.
Ant. 308 oio< ὑμὶν Ἀιδης μοῦνος ἀρκέσει.
Propertius imitates 11, 5. 4. 17 ‘E satis
una malae poterit mors esse puellae';
Paley, iu loc, refers the expression to
the Greek πολλάκις, μυριάκις, τεθνάναι.

levis, ‘is light for,' i. e. ‘a light
punishment fors

58. virgiuum eulpae. Orelli points
out (against Markland, who wished to
read ‘virginis') that the plural softens,
by generalising, the truth. She feels
the special application, but is likely to
shrink from expressing it. Similarly,
Bentley injures the delicacy of the pas·
sage by changing ‘vitiis ’ to ‘vitio' The
reasons which he gives for the change-
the generality 01 the plural and the
technical use of the singular as almost =
‘stuprum ³—really indicate Horace’s
purpose in preferring ‘vitiis'

41. porta eburna3 Hom. Od. 19.
562 foll, Virg. Aen. 6. 894.

4²· somnium ducit, 'the fancy
brings a dream,' ie. comes in a dream.

47.enitar,‘lwoulduseallmystrength';
it contrasts with ‘rnultum amati.⁵

48. monstri. Some good MSS. have
