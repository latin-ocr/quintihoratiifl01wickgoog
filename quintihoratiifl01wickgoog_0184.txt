tran. 011. 16.

Condidit'lunam neque certa fulgent
Sidera nautis3

Otium bello furiosa Thrace,

Otium Medi pharetra decori,

Grospus non gemmis neque purpura ve-

nale neque auro.
Non enim gazae neque consularis ι
Summovet lictor miseros turnultus ῃ
, Mentis et curas laqueata circum Ι ”’
Tecta volantes.
Vivitur parvo bene, cui paternum
Splendet in mensa tenui salinum,
Nec leves somnos tImor aut cupido
, Sordidus aufert.
Quid brevi fortes iaculamur aevo
Multa? Quid terras allo calentes

Thracian sigh is the same which is the roof of the rich man’s hall.

true subject ol the Ode. ‘The trader
prays lor [bodily] rest, but it is only in
the moment os storm; the Thracian, the
Mede-—but their hearts are in war; we
too wish sor rest [ol mind], but speud
our lives in the cares and hurry which
banish it.q

a. prensus, καταληφθείς, apparently
a technical word for ‘caught in a
storm‚’ as ‘ deprensus* Virg. G. 4. 421.

3. certa, ‘on which to rely,' not as
though there were some stars ‘certa'
others ‘incerta’

5. bello furiosa, Ἀρειμανήε, ‘Ma-
vortia tellus' Virg. Aen. 5. 13.

6. pharetra decori. Their very
adomment belles their prayer.

7. Grosphe. The personal address
serves to point the separation of the
allegory from its application: ‘for
peace, Grosphus-peace, which gems,
ete, will not huy!

non venale, οὐκ ὠνητόν, Thuc. 3. 40,
etc. For the division ol the word be-
tween the two verses see Orl. 1. 2. 20,
1. 25. 11.

10. summovet, the proper word of a
lictor clearing the way lor the consul,
‘i, lictor, summove turbam‚’ Liv. 3. 48,
etc. ‘The tumults’ of the mind is a
continuation ol the metaphor.

11. Cares are represented as a flock
01¹ ill-omened birds or harpies that fly
round and round under the panelled

laqueata, 2. 18. 2.

15. vivitur parvo bene, eui,sc. ‘ab
illo cui,’ ⁴ A happy lile is his, though his
means be small, on whose modest board,’
etc.; ‘vivere parvo' occurs Sat. a. a. ι’.
The silver salt-cellar (Pers. S. 3. ²5
‘rure paterno Est tihi sar modicum
purum et sine labe salinum ⁹), an heir-
loom of the house, is used as a test of
respectable competence. Poverty would
use a shell (Sat. 1. 5. 14 ⁶ concha salis
puri ⁹). Luxury wouldnot be content
with the one piece ol old-iashioned
plate. ‘Splendet' is antithetical to
‘tenuh’ lt is the ⁵ one ornament of the
modest board’ perhaps also like the
epithets ‘purum' ‘puri‚' it implies
cleanliness. ‘·lamdudum splendet focus
et tibi munda supellex! Epp. 1. 5. 7.

15. leves somnos, ‘untroubled’ 5.
1. 21 foll.

cupido, masculine, as always in Ho-
race where the gender is marked, Od.
3. 16. 39, 3. 24. 51, Sat. 1.1.61‚Epp.
1.1. 3. ,
misertos, like ‘ andare omnia per-
peti,² Od. 1. 3. 36; no trouble or dis·
