LIB. IV.

ΟΠ. 14.

Vexare turmas et frementem
Mittere equum medios per ignes*
Sic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus
Qui regna Dauni praefluit Apuli,
Cum saevit horrendamque cultis
Diluviem meditatur agris
Ut barbarorum Claudius agmina
Ferrata vasto diruit impetu
Primusque et extremos ¹metendo
Stravit humum sine elade' victor,

24. per ignes. Bentley, as usual, is
far better than his critias. His way out
’ of the difficulty, by substituting conjec-
turally ¹ enses] is not one in which we
can follow him. But he disposes‚ iu
advance. of all the parallels which are
still quoted ou the view that the ex·
pressiori is metaphorioal= ‘per medium
ardorem puguae‚' Corn. Cruq. One
class, such as Virgil's ‘mediasacies
mediosque per ignes,’ Aen. 7. 696661-
cate the direct opposite, for they refer
to the literal lires ol Troy; and Silius’
imitations (14. 175 aud 15. 41) are just
the same—the lires are as literal as the
swords. The other class, such as Ho-
race's own ‘per mare ..per saxa, per
16665,Ἇ Epp¹ 1. 1. 43, ‘ignes Per medios
fluviosque ruentis? Sat. a. 3. 56, estab-
lish the proverbial use of ‘fire‚' as oue
among many metaphors of extreme
dangersorobstacles; but do not parallel
the substitution ol ‘to ride bis horse
through the middle ot the tire,' for
‘through the hottest figur? We have
gone too far in the sentence with un·
metaphorical language, to tolerate being
pulled up suddenly bya bold metaphor.

rum? It is a disputed question whether
the original idea was os the hom-like
branchings of a river, or of its violence,
or of its morlog: μεμυκὼς ἠΰτε ταῦρος,
Hom. 11. 21. 237, of the Xanthus. Cp.
‘longe sonans· oi the Aufidus, 4. 9. a.
But whatever was its origin, Horace
probably feels the image suggested by
the epithet through the following lines;
so that there is almost asimile within
the simile. Tiberius is like the Aufidus
in llood: the Aufidus is like a buil
clrarging down the mountain side.

28. meditatur. The good MSS. are
divided between this word and ‘mini-
tatum' Porph. read ‘meditatur‚' though
some little doubt is thrown on his testi-
mony also by variante of MSS, and
Servius quotes it to illustrate Georg. 3.

Porph.’s 'criticism ‘maledixit “medi-
tatur'’ quia in ipso actu estnec debet
cogitare aut condiscere quod iam facit,'
seems to be that the image is uot of the
river actually fiooding the lowlands, but
of the boilingwaters os its upper course
filling its channel to the brim, and
threateniug a flood to the lower lovels.¹

30. dicirit. This verb, more com-1
mouly used ol laying buildings in min,
is justified here, ou the oue side, by the
image oi the river, ὅε r? dvo ῥέων ἐκέ-
δασσε γεφῦραε (Hom. l. c.); on the
other, by the epithet oi ‘agmina'3 the
‘steelclad lines’ are looked at as fortifi-
cationswhich were to be levelled.
