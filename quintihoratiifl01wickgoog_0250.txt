Demersa exiti03 diffidit urbium
Portas vir Macedo et subruit aemulos
Reges muneribus; munera navium

‘urbes' are such as Olynthus, Pydna,

14. aemulos reges, such ashis rivals
sor the throne, Pausanias and Argaeus ;
the Thracian Cersobleptes etc.

15. navium duces. Horace is gener-
ally supposed to be taking an instance
from contemporary history, aad to aim
at Menas or Metrodorus, the freedman
of SextusPompeius and chief captain of
his fleat, who twice deserted him to
serve under Octavius, and once deserted
Octavius to return to hirn. See Introd.
to Epod. 4, which has been taken by
some to refer to him.

23. nudus. Tojoin the army ol the
‘nil cupi t'es' he must be, like them,
‘nudus '; e must strip himself of the
gifts of fortune which he no longer
wants, and be content with the cloak oi
which he speaks in 3. ²9· 54. The
metaphor of the camp hardly begins
till ‘castra’ Orelli points out that the
second clause. ‘transfuga . . gestio! is an
amplifi cation oi the rinnand one which
brings out more clearly, though it cloes
