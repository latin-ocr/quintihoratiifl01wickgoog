HORATII CARMINUM

Aiacem3 tamen heu serus adulteros
Crines pulvere collines.
Non Laertiaden, exitium tuae
Genti, non Pylium Nestora respicis?
Urgent impavidi te Salaminius
Teucer et Sthenelus solens
Pugnae, sive opus est imperitare equis,
Non auriga piger3 Merionen quoque
Nosces, Ecce furit te reperire atrox
Tydides melior patre,
Quem tu, cervus uti vallis in altera
Visum parte lupum graminis immemor,
Sublimi fugies mollis anhelitu,
Non hoc pollicitus tuae.
iracunda diem proferet llio
Matronisque Phrygum classis Achillel3
Post certas hiemes uret Achaicus
ignis Iliacas domos.

20. oriues. The MSS. are divided
between this and ‘cultus’ ‘ ornaments?
Aer. read ‘crines' as he illustratas it
by Virg. Aen. 12. 99 ‘foedare in pulvere
crines! And the reference seems to be
to the line of Hom. quoted on v. 13.
With ‘adulteros crines‚’ cp. ‘impia
cervice,’ 3.1.17; ‘tirnido tergo,’ 5. a.
163 ‘libero tergo‚’ 3. 5. ea; ‘iratos re-
gum apices,' 3. 21. 20; and in Gr. ἐξ
ἐλευθέρου tipus, Aesch. Ag. 328.

24. With some hesitation Ihave fol-
lowed Orelli in reading ‘Teucer et';
Ritter, Dillenburger‚ and Keller, give
‘Teucer te.’ The MSS. are fairly di·
vided between these two readings and
‘ Teucerque et‚’ which Bentley preferred.
The Scholiasts do not help us, and
though Cruquius says that 3 Bland.
read ‘ Teucer te,' he does not distinctly
cite the oldest. The considerations in
favour of ‘ et' are: (1) that there was
an obvious metrieal reason for altering
it; (a) that this reason, with the read·
ing itseli, explains the double variation
‘te,' ‘que et.¹ What could be the mo-
tive for altering either ol these to the
other? (3) the number of ‘urgent’
‘Teucerque' is awkward, as the position
of ‘que' would seem to make ‘Sala-

minius’ an epithet of Sthenelus as well
as Teucer.

solens pugnae, Homer's μάχηε εὖ
εἰδώς, ‘citharae sciens,' Od. 3. 9. ro.
Orelli points out that the lorrn ‘sciens
. . sive opus est,' etc„ is very likely from
Hom. Od. p 49 ἐπιστάμενοι μὲν ἀφ’
ἵππων Ἀνδρασι μάρνασθαι καὶ ὅτε χρὴ
πεζὸνέόντα.

27.nosoes‚‘thoushaltcometokuow!

furit reperire, App. at r.

28. melior patre, from Hom. 11. 4.
405, where Sthenelus says, ἡμεῖς τοι πα-
τέρων μέγ’ ἀμείνονες εὐχόμεθ’ εἶναι.

31. sublimi. a translation apparently
oi μετεώρῳ, Liddell and Scott compare
the phrase πνεῦμ’ ἔχειν ἅνω, ‘to be out
of breath.¹ The breath ‘is stopped mid·
way‚’ can't get down, but stays at the
entrance of the lungs.

53. iracunda elassis, the anger
vghich kept Achilles' ships apart from
terest.

diem proferet, ‘shall postpone the
day ofdoom.’

34. Achillei, see on Ulyxei, Od. 1.

the line and in v. 24. see Index of
