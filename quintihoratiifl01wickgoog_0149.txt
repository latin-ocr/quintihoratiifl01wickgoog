handling (λάμπει γὰρ ἓν χρείαισιν· ὥσπερ
{nuperis ydaros, Soph. Fr. 742, quoted
by Ritter); secundarily and metaphori-
cally‚ to the right nse oi money. ln the
epithet ‘temperato,’ on the contrary. the
moral sense is the predominant one.

5-8. An instance oi the wisely directed
use of which he speaks. Acron’s note
is, ‘Proculeius qui pius sic erga iratres
suos Scipionem et Murenam fuit ut curn
spoliatis bello civili patrimonium suum
de integro divideret,¹ in which ⁶ Scipio·
nem' hasbeen ingeniously altered by
Estre' to ‘Caepionem’ the name oi the
person who suffered with Murena ior a
conspiracy against Augustus in ac. 22.
There is no reason, however, irom any
other authority, to suppose that the two
were brothers, It may perhaps be
doubted whether Horace's words neces-
sarily irnply that Proculeius had more
tliarr one brother: the plural generalises.
Thai he was the brother (or cousin, for
this doubt always besets the words
, ‘irater’ and ridendis) of Murena (Od. 3.
19. 11, Sat. 1. 5. 38), the ‘Licinius' oi
Od. 2. 10, and the brother oi Maecenas'
wife Terentia, we know from Dio 54. 3.
Proculeius washigh in Augustus' favour;
so much so, that he is named as one oi
the persons to whom at different times
the emperor had thought of marrying
his daughter Julia (Tac. Arm. 4. 40).
Juvenal (7. 94)¹ couples him with, Mae.-
cenas as a patron oi literature. ’

5. viaet extento aevo, ’0111111110
beyond the term oi lise.¹ Cp. Virg. Aen.
10. 468 ‘breve et irreparabile tempus
Omnibus est vitae; sed lamam extendere
lactis Hoc virtutis opus!

6. notus animi, cp. probably the
same construction Od. 4. 13. 21 ‘nota
artium! Horace uses the Greek gen.
of relation to avoid the awkwardness of
a preposition, ‘notus propter’ or ‘oby

y. aget, ‘will carry on, his way‚’ will
not allow him totali, as he ‘volitat

virus per ora virum.' The weight os

MS· testimony and Aer, though not
Porph.‚ are in favour of the future as
against ‘agit’ and it is preferable also
as suiting better with ‘vivet,’ and as
not implying, what there is no reason
otherwise to suppose, that Proculeius
was dead at this time.

metuentesolvi,‘thatdarenotdroop‚'

5. ao. Virgil had the expression first,
G. 1. 246 ‘Arctos metuentes aequore

ΞΜ, like Virgil's ‘solvi membra,'
λύεσθαι ι or possibly„ as Ritter suggests,
with a remembrance of Icarus' fate,
whose wings were fastened with wax and
melted in the sun. Cp. in a similar
metaphorieal description os posthumous ’
fame, ‘Daedaleo notior Icaro‚' Od. 2.
1013.

9. latius regnes. ln the following
stanzas Horace is thinking of the Stoic
paradox, that the wise man is king.
Cp. Sat. 1. 3.125‚136‚Epp. 1. 1. roy,
eto, Sen. Thyest. 334 soll. ⁶ Regem non
iaciunt opes’ etc.

10-12. ‘Than if your property stretch·
ed into the far South and West, so as to
unite in one sway Carthage and its
Spanish colonias! Gades was one of
these: see Cic. pro Balbo 14, Liv. 28.
87. The expression should be compared
with Od. 3.16.31,41 ‘F uigentem imperio
fertilis Africae‚' ‘Mygdoniis regnum
Alyattei Campis eontinnem' Horace is
not speaking in either case of proconsul·
ships, but os the ‘latifundia’ (see on
Ori. 1. 1. 9), which were one of the
favourite means of investing and acquir-
ing wealth. Seneca expands this as other
Horatian metaphora Epp. 89, ‘Hoc
quoque parvum est nisi latifundiis ves·
tris maria cinxistis: nisi trans Hadriam
et Ionium, Aegaeumque vester villicus
regnet.. sit fundus quod aliquando im-

perium uocabatur.' Inboth passages ol

Horace the metaphor of royalty is sug·
gested by the context —here by ‘latius
regnes' and the allusion to Phraates,
1113. 16 by ‘dominus splendidior' and
⁶ vectigalia'
