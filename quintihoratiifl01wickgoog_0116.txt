‘doctus iuvenis’ which was the talk of Tarentum on some occasion when Horace
was staying there. He has been drowned on the Illyrian shore (v. aa), but his
shade revisits Tarentum, apostrophizes Archytas, whose tomb is placed there, and
appearing to a sailor‚ bids him stop on his voyage to throw dust on its unburied
empse, as he hopes for a prosperous return to more western waters (v. 26).

Others have supposed that the imaginary corpse is Horace’s own. He had
been nearly lost at sea once off Cape Palinurus (Od. 3. 4, αθ). The scenery of
this Ode will hardly suit that occasi0n; but the event may have filled his mind
with thoughts and images of shipwreck. ,

In my notes Ι have inclined to Dillenburger's interpretation, pot as a completely
satisfactory one, but as less far-fetched than most. and involving fewer difficulties,
and as giving the Ode a thoroughly Horatian tone. That Archytas had a tomb
on the sea-coast, near Mount Garganus, is no't a fact of history, nor in any way less
an assumption of the interpreter than that he was drowned and cast ashore there,

We may notice that Horace seems to have been interested in the Pythagoreas
doctrines, and especially in that of Metempsychosis and yet not disinelined to
speak playfullyof thern, Epod. 15. ar, Epp. 2. r. 52, S. 2. 6. 62. He ranks
Pythagoras with Socrates and Plato as representing the great teachers of Greek
philosophy, s, α. 4. 3. ’

Archytas was a Greek of Tarentum, and lived in thl fourth century nc. Like
the rest of the Pythagoream school of philosophers he was a great mathematician.
