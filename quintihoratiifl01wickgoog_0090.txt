naufragum, actively, as Virg. Aen.
3. 5 53 ‘navifragum Scylaceum!

12. Iuppiter ipse ruens, cp. Od. 3. 3.
7 ‘Si fractus illabatur orbis impavidum
lerient ruinae.’ The expression here
contains a remembrance of Zeis καται-
βάτης, though the thought is not so

= much, as it is in the Greek, of the

Ἴ tlrunderbolt, as of the vault ol heaven
cracking, ‘ruit arduos aether,¹ Virg. G.
1. 324, of the lightning, thuoder, and
rain; lor ‘Iuppiter' of the sky, cp. Od.
1. r. 2 5.

13 loll. The legendos Prometheus '

does not appear in this form in extant
Greek literature, see on Od. t. 7. 21 and
Epod.13introd. He is the creator of
man in the myth of Plato’s Protagoras.
15-16. The simplest construction is
to take ⁶ addere’ after ‘coactus’ ¹ appo-
suisse' after ‘fertus' giving to ‘et' the
sense of ‘etiam’ ‘also' ‘among the
rest.' Two other ways are proposed: '
(1) to take both infinitives alter ‘ fertur,’
‘et' coupling thern together. It would
be hard to justify the change of tense,
lor which there is no reason as there
obviously is in Od. 3. 20.11,the pas-
sage usually quoted in illustration; (a)
to supply ‘esse’ with ‘coactus' ‘fertur

r coactus esse . . et apposuisse '; cp. Tac.

14. undique, from every animab
A. Ρ, 3 ‘Undique collatis membris!
The Schol. Cruq. adds (possibly from
an older commentator, and so conceiv-

ably from some juller version of the

legend), ‘Sic tim rem deprompsit a le-
pore, a volpe astutiam?

16. vim, to be taken closely with
‘ insani} which defines, its meaning, ‘the
force of the lion's fury.’

sionate revenge in Greek Tragedy. Cp.
Od. 1. 6. 8 ‘Saevam Pelopis domum!

18. ultimae, the furthest off, the first
iink ol the chain. Ritter quotes Virg.
Aen. 7. 49 ‘tu sanguinis ultimus auctor?
...¹⁹..titt'tnlhlttttttitt
wishes to feel again something ol a
living metaphor . in the verb, though
it is not quite evident what the me-
taphor is. Cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 553
‘stant belli causae’ There it seems
to be ‘they are on loot, in lull life ancl
strength, there is no need to use any
more efforts to arouse them’ Here
perhaps the verb cannot be altogether
separated lrum ‘ ultimae! ‘They have
been the primary and sufficient cause,’
that which stands oi its own strength,
leans on no other.

ao. imprimeret murts arsurumne
plough the site of a conquered city was
a token (or a metaphor) of its total cle·

Palladiae ligneus artis equus’ Cp.
Aesch. Ag. 526.
