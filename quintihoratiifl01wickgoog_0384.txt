EPODE IX..

‘Wrrau shall we have our feast, Maecenas, to celebrate Caesar’svictory as we
celebrated the defeat of Sextus Pompeius alittle 'while ago? Oh, the shame to
think of Roman soldiers in Cleopatra's effeminate camp! Eyen Galatiau horsemen
deserted her, and her lieet would not fight. Why is not the triumphal processioa
already moving-the triumph of a captain greater than Marius or the younger
Scipio? Our foe has changed his scarlet for mourning‚ and fled across the sea
with no harbour to go to. Bring wine, boy, and the largest cups; we may
forget all our anxieties for Caesar's welfare.'

Compare Od. 1. 37 Introd, Introd. to Books iiii, § 1, and Introd. to the Epodes„
This Epode is manifestly written on the receipt of the news of the battle of
Actium, and before the subsequent fate of Cleopatra and Antony was known,
when even the direction of their ssight was a matter of conjecture, vv. 29-32,Ι
