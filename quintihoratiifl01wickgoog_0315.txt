HORATII CARMINUM

Affulsit populo, gratior it dies
Et soles melius nitent.
Ut mater iuvenem, quem Notus invido
Flatu Carpathii trans maris aequora
Cunctantem spatio 'longius annuo
Dulci distinet a domo,
Votis ominibusque et precibus vocat,
Curvo nec faciem litore dimovet:
Sic desideriis icta fidelibus
Quaerit patria Caesarem.
Tutus bos etenim rura perambulat, ,
Nutrit rura Ceres almaque Faustitas,
Pacatum volitant per mare navitae,
Culpari metuit Fides,
Nullis polluitur casta domus stupris,
Mos et lex maculosum edomuit nesae,
Laudentur simili prole puerperae,
Culpam poena premit comes.
