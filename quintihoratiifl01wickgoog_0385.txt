HORATII EPODON

Minatus Urbi vincla, quae detraxerat
Servis amicus perfidis
Romanus, ehem-posteri negabitis-
Emancipatus feminae
’ Fert vallum et arma miles et spadonibus
Servire rugosis potest,
Interque signa turpe militaria
Sol adspicit conopium.
Ad hunc frementes uerterunt bis mille equos
Galli, canentes Caesarem,

10. servis, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘detrax-
erat' and ‘amicus' see on Od. 1. 3. 6.

11. posteri negabitis, Cp. Od. a. 19.
1r‘credite‚posteri,'ofsomethingstrauge.

12. emancipatus, ‘sold as a slave?
Cic. Phil. 2. 21 ‘venditum atque emau-
cipatum tribunatum,⁵ Plaut. Bacch. 1.1.
59 ‘Nunc mulier tibi me emancipo;
tuus sum, tibi operam do! ‘Emanci-
pare' abs. is ‘to free from “manci-
pium‚'’' with adai. it came to mean ‘to
transfer from one “mancipium” to
another,' ‘to sell.’

13. fert vallum et arma, i.e. ‘is a
Roman soldier still in discipline and en-
durance.’ Compare Ciceros account of
what a soldier carried on his march,
Tusc. 2. 16 ‘Militiae nostri exercitus qui
labor et quantus agminis, ferre plus di-
midiati mensis cibaria, ferre si quid ad
usum velint, ferre vallum! Nam scutum,
galeam, gladium, in onere nostri milites
non plus numerant quam humeros, la-
certos, manus: arma enim membra mi-
litis esse dieunt? ‘Vallus' is a stake
for palisading.

et spadonibus, see on Od. 1. 37. o.
‘Et' from the context acquires the force
of ‘ et tamen?

14. potest, in the sense of τλῆναι,
see onOd. 3.11.31.

16. eol adspicit, a trope common to
all natipns, ‘before all lsrael and before
thesun.

aesopiam, agauze curtain or tent to
- keep off mosquitoes. ThepRomans de-
spised it as a sign of effeminacy; see
Paley on Prop. 4. 11. 45 ‘Foedaque
Tarpeio conopia tendere saxo.⁵ Pro-
bably there is a special emphasis of
scorn on the foreign name as in Ju-
venal's ‘Rusticusilie tuus sumit tre·
chedipna, Quirine, Et ceromatico fert
niceteria collo.'

17. adhunc frementes, ‘chaiing at
such a sight'3 ‘hunc'=‘militern spa·
donibus servientem’ Compare perhaps
the use of‘hic'in Od. 3. 5. 37. It has
also been taken (like ‘hostis' and ‘ille'
in 27, 29) of Antonius, whose name
Horace avoids <see Introd. to Od. 1, 37),
but who is sufficiently indicated in the
foregoing verses. For the construction
we may perhaps quote (with Bentley)
Epp. 1. 19. 45 ‘Ad haec ego naribus uti
Formido‚' though it is a stronger sup·
port to his own reading ‘ad hoc? The
general meaning is well given by Porph.
‘[Gallorutn] ideo mentio facta estut
Romanos qui sub praepositis spadonibus
aequo animo militarent magis oneraret
per comparationem Gallorum qui hoc
dedignati ad Caesarem se contuleruut!
The sense is not altered, while the con·

'struction is made simple by Bentley's

illidii, tiitttlttt {lilia
MSS. give no encouragement to either.
‘Ad hunc' is the reading which has the
best MS. authority (but B omits most of
the Epode, and there is no testimony to
the reading of V), and it was interpreted
by Acron. The other readings with re·
spectable authority are ‘adhuc’ which
must be taken with ‘frementes’ ‘up till
this time neighing for tlte light’; and ‘at
huc,’ which was read by the Comm.
Cruq, and interpreted by him ‘but to
our side’; cp. Vell. 2. 84 ‘Hinc ad
Antonium nemo; illinc ad Caesarem
quotidie aliquid transfugiebat.' Neither
seems to connect the lines with those
that precede as well as ‘ad hune*

18. Galli: These were Galatians,
who, with their prince Deiotarus, de·
serted to Octavius at the commencement
of the battle of Actium, Plut. Ant. 63.
