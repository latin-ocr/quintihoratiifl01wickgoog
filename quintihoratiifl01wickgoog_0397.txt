HORATII EPODON

EPODE XVI.

‘A secono generation is passing away in civil war. Roman hands are doing
what no foemam in Italy or beyond ir, has been able to do. The site of Rome
will be once more desolate; barbarian conquerors will ride over it, and scatter
with their horse-honis the bones of Romulus. Do you ask the reuredyl Let us
fly like the Phocaeans-leave hearth and home, and fly-anywl1e1·e; only never to
come back again till stone swinns and every law of nature is changed. Let us all
gowall, or all that have men's hearts in them. We shall find ahorne beyond the
Ocean. There are the Happy lslauds, where the earth yields its fruit without
labour, where the powers of nature never injure, where commerce has never corne
to taint man, nor plague to taint cattle. J0ve set thern apart forthe good when he
turned the golden age to bronze-to bronze and then to iron. lt is time for· those
who are good to seek the offered refuge?

See Introd. to Epod. 7. The two poerns belong to the same phase of feeling.
They may have been written at any time when Horace had begnn to sichen of the
aimless bloodshed of the civil war, and before he had seen or reconciled himself to
the praelicat remedy which Octavianus offered for it. At present the suggestion
of a mode of escape from it is not more than a poetical mode of expressing its
hopelessness. He cannot see its issue, any more than in Epod. 7 he cau see its
causes

The Pseudo-Acron quotes from a lost work of Sallust, to the effect that Sertorius
aster his defeat, thought of saillng into the Atlantic in search of the fabled islands
of the blest‚ ‘ad insulas Fortunatas voluisse ire’ The genuineness of the quotation
is confirmed by Servius, who, on Virg. Aen. 5. 735, refers to Sallust as having
spoken of the μακάρων νῆσοι. Plutarch tells the same story in the life of Sertorius
ch. 9. It is very possible that Horace may have heard it, and that ir may have
suggested the conclusion of the Epode.

Compare the description of the Happy letands both in thought and expression
with Virgil’s Golden Age in Ecl. 4. ¹
