EPODE XVII.

Horace-I yield, Canidia. Iacknowledge your¹ power; cease your spella
Achilles took compassion on Telephus, and gave back Hector’s body to Priam's
prayers. Circe restored Ulysses’ companions to their own form. 11011 have
punished me enough. Ihave lost the hue of youth; my hair is white; Icannot
rest day or night. I deny the power os your spells no more, for Ι have felt them.
Spare mei O earth and sea, 1 burn with the tire of Nessus' poison or of Aetna.
When is it to endi Ι will do anything you ask; offer ahecatomb; tune my lyre
to falsehood, and sing of you as chaste and good. Stesichorus recovered his sight
on his palinode. You don’t come of base parents; you never plundered graveyards;
your beart is kind and your hands are clean; Pactumeius is your true son.

Canidia-Nou speak 10 sealed ears. Are you to escape scot free aster divuiging
the mysteries of Cotytto and witnessing they witcheraft of the Esquiline, only to ⁵
make it the talk 01 the town? If you do Ι shall have wasted my labour. You
wish to die, but you shall live to suffer. Tantalus, and Prometheus, and Sisyphus
would like to be set free from their punishment; but they are not. There isno
escape. The sword shall not pierce you, the noose shall not choke you. Iwill
ride in triumph on your neck. Ι can call the moon from the sky and raise the dead
from their urus. Do you think Ι can't deal with you?

Under the form of a recantation offered by himself and rejected by Canidia, he
repeats and aggravates the attacks upon ber of Epod. 5 and Sat. 1. 8. Her witch-
crast is taken 101 granted by both speakers. New or more definite charges are
made against her, though they are put in the form ‘you did n0t‚’ etc. She allows
every charge, and is angry only 11 their disclosure. The tone is more personal
than before. It is no longer Varus or some unnamed victim of her spells, but
Horace (see esp. v. 58), and it gives an interpretation to the other two poems. If
they had stood alone we might have thought that it was a class, or a public folly,
that he was assailing. But here we can hardly doubt that we have a personal
enmhy, iuvolying more or less of real bitterness, and expressed under a form more
or less allegorical. It is impossible to read the riddle completely. Horace doubt·
less dramatizes imaginary situations, but it is not in his way to sustain an imaginary
character through three entire poems, besides making it the object of allusions in
several others. Cp. Epod. 3. 8, Sat. 2. 1. 48, 2. 8. 95, and see introdto Od. 1. 16.
‘This Epode is posterior to Epod5 and Sat. 1. 8, 101 it contains references to them;
see vv. 47-52, 58.

IAM iam efficaci do manus scientiae,
Supplex et oro regna per Proserpinae,

1. do manus, ‘yield'; Cic. ad Att. 2, Proserpinae . .Dianae; Epod. 5.
2. 22 ‘Aiebat illurn primo sane diu multa 51, They are the powers 01 night and
contra, ad extremum aurem manus de· the lower world, to whom witchesmight
disse' be supposed to pray.
