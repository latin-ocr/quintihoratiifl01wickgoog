purity of the hand which offers the
acceptable gift may be assumed by the
poet, bnt it is not expressed. The doo-
trine is simply that the gods do not
look for costly offerings from humble
worshippers. If ‘immunis' meant ‘im-
munis scelerum‚’ it would be the most
weighty word in the Ode, and Horace
would not have left his readers to make
up the distinctive part of its meaning by
conjecture. The three last lines oi the
stanza have been constrned variously.
The interpretation given above is that
followed by Orelli, Ritter, and Dillr.
Bentley took ‘sumptuosa hostia' as a
nominative, defending the ἔι either as
lengthened by the following ‘bl.' or as
the parallel of ‘sinon periret immisera-

which seem like imitations; and we
rnay probably follow Bentley in refusing
to admit what would be a solitary in-
stance in Horace of this form of tbe
future in adoubtful reading, and against
the silence of the old grammarians,
who are qnick to notice any such
varieties.

that the craefnng of the salt in the fire
