HORATII EPODON

Quidum, quibus te vita si superstite
Iucunda, si contra, gravis?

Utrumne iussi persequemur otium,
Non dulce, ni tecum simnl,'

An hunc laborem mente laturi decet
Qua ferre non molles viros?

Feremus et te vel per Alpium iuga
inhospitalem et Caucasum

Vel Occidentis usque ad ultimum sinum ἵ
Forti sequemur pectore.

RogeS, tuum labore quid iuvem me0, 15
Imbellis ac firmus parum?

¹ Comes minore sum futurus in metu,

Qui maior absentes habet;

Ut assidens implumibus pullis avis
Serpentium allapsus timet

Magis relictiS, non, ut adsit, auxili
Latura plus praesentibus

5. si superstite. This was read by
Porph, who notiees the difficulty os
construction, and gives the true explana·
tion, viz. that ‘sit' has to be understood
both with ‘te superstite’ and with ⁶ eon·
tra,' ⁶ if it be spent in thy lifetime.’ It
is not harder than ‘ni tecum simul 'just
below. Α sew MSS. omit ‘si,’ leaving
the verse umnetricah and some oi the
old editions have ‘ sit' Ritter cx conj.
‘si est.¹

7. utrumne . . an. Cicero has (pro
Quint. 30) ‘utrum possitne se . . deien-
dere.. an . . addicatur.' where the usage
is logicaHy correct, ‘which ol the two
things? this? or that i' The coalescing
of the two words is poetical, and does
not appear in prose writers till the silver
age. Horace uses ⁶ ne ¹ with interroga-
tives more freely than other writers, eg.
‘uteme’ Sat. 2. a. roy, ‘quine’ Sat. 1.1o.
21, ⁶ quone‚’ Sat. 2. 3. 295, ‘quantana’
Sat. a. 3. 317.

iussi, ‘as you bid us!

9. Best taken with Nauck, ‘An hunc
lahorem [persequemur]‚ laturi [eum]
mente,’ etc. He points ont that ‘Fere-
mus' ansvers the question of ‘laturi’
‘sequemur’ (r. 14) of ‘persequemur'
Others make ‘laturi’=‘laturi sumus,'
the verb of the sentence.

12. inhospitalem Caucasum, Od. 1.
22. 6. .
13. sinum, Virg. G. 2. 123 ⁶ extremi
sinus orbis⁸ where see Conington. It
would seem here to mean the last wind·
ing of the shore as it trends westward
towards the Atlantis, so that it is the

equivalent of ‘ Gades’ in Od. 2. 6. 1.

16. See on Od. 2. 7. to.

19. assidens, ofthe general time that
she has a callow brood, for at the
rppmmt, ex hypothesi, she has left
tem.

nr. ut adsit, ‘eren supposing she
were present,’ Madvig. L. G. § 440 a,
obs. 4, so Cic. pro. Mil. 17, ‘Ut enim
neminem aliurn nisi T. Patinam fami·
liarissimum suum rogasset, soirepotuit,’
etc, andsoalso, ifthe subjunctive be read
there, Mur. 34 ‘si ut suffragentur
nihil valent gratia) Bentley, objecting
to the tautology of‘ut adsit,' ‘praesen-
tibus' would adopt ‘uti sit‚’ ‘non uti
being=‘non qn0,' ‘not that she could
give,³ etc. This was the reading of one
(it is not said the oldest) oi Cruquius'
MSS, and he draws support ior it irem
the unmetrical ‘ut sit’ which is found in
several MSS. amongst which are φ, ψ, nu.
The vulg. was iuterpreted by Porph.
