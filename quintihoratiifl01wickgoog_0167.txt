HORATII CARMINUM

Querceta Gargani laborant
Et foliis viduantur orni:
Tu semper urges flebilibus modis
Mysten ademptum, nec tibi Vespero
Surgente decedunt amores

Nec rapidum fugiente Solem.

At non ter aevo functus amabilem

Annos, nec impubem parentes
Troilon aut Phrygiae sorores
Flevere semper. Desine mollium
Tandem querelarum, et potius nova
Cantemus Augusti tropaea
Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten, ιο
