LIB. IV. OD. 8. ’

Post mortem ducibus, non celeres fugae
Reiectaeque retrorsum Hannibalis minae,

Non incendia Karthaginis impiae
Eine, qui domita nomen ab Africa
Lucratus rediit, clarius indicant

’ Laudesquam Calabrae Pierides: neque,
Si chartae sileant quod benefeceris,
Mercedem tuleris, Quod foret'lliae
Mavortisque puer, si taciturnitas
Obstaret meritis invida Romuli?
Ereptum Stygiis fluctibus Aeacum

’ Virtus et favor et lingua potentium
Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis,
Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori:

ol his policyand hereditary transmission
os his same, win lor him the glory that
*Ennius* poetry wins for hina' The
nuth, however, is perhaps that Horace
is (not coniusing, but) consciously unit·
ingthe two Scipios. ‘What throws most
glory ou the name ol Africanus? Zama
and the destruction of Carthage, or
Ennius’ poetryl' ‘Eius qui. .rediit,’ is
merely a periphrasis for the name ‘Afri-
canus,’ and Horace could have used it
apparently of the younger Scipio, as he
uses os him in Sat. 2. 1. 65 the peri·

’ phrasis ‘qui Duxit ab oppressa meritum 33

Carthagine nornen! Cp. the words
which Cicero puts into the mouth of
Scipio Africanus Major as addressed to
his grandson, ‘Hanc [Carmaginem]
evertes, eritque cognomen id tibi per te
partum quod habes adhuc a nobis here·
ditarium,’ Somn. Scip. 11. In favour oi
this view is the fact already pointed
out, that the sentiment is really general,
‘famous deeds’ are specialised, after

. Horace's manner, into ‘the deeds os the

two Scipios,' and poetry is specialised
into the poetry of (or such as that of)
Ennius; but} we may remember that
Scipio’s exploits were only the last in
the long series ol glories which formed
the subject otEnnius' poem. Tbat it

lact that Horace might ignore.

15. fugae . . minae. The lligbt oi
Hannibal from Italy, and the return on
his own head, by Scipio’s invasion ‚ol
Africa, of the threats he had offered to
Rome by his invasion of Italy. ,

Aeacus' merits, like Romulus’ birth,
only heighten our sense of the poete
