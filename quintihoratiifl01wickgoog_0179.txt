146 HORATII CARMINUM

O DE XIV.

‘Tne years are flying, Postumus3 no prayers will stay them; not three heca·
tombs a day will turn the heart 01 Pluto the tearless, 1110 almighty, who hold
Geryon last, despite his three bodies, and Tityos, behind the Styx, aye, the Styx,
which we must all cross alike, rich and poor. Yon may avoid all common risks,
yet you must die. The treasures that you have boarded your wiser heir will
squander.’

The burden is the sameas that 01 Od. 2. 3 and 11, and os 4. 7 ‘Life is short, let
us enjoy it while we mayr’ but 111010 is more 01 sadness in this Ode than in the
others. The usual 100101 is hinted in the passing epithet ⁸ dignior' bestowed on the
heir who is to waste our store of choicewine; but the feeling of the stanza is not so
much 101 his wisdorn as lor the additional bitterness which 11 adds 10 001 labours
to know that they may be all undone as soon as we are dead. ‘We must leave it
0010 0 1000 that shall be 01101 00, and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise
man or a sooli' Eccles. a. 19. There is 00 0100 10 1110 person addressed. 111100
