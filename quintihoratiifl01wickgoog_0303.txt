Concines maiore poeta plectro

Caesarem, quandoque trahet feroces

Per sacrum clivum merita decorus

Quo nihil maius meliusve terris

Fata donavere bonique divi

Nec dabunt, quamvis redeant in aurum
Tempora priscum. ’

Concines laetosque dies nt Urbis

Publicum ludum super impetrato

Fortis Augusti reditu forumque
Litibus orbum.

Turn meae, si quid loquar audiendum,

Pulcher! o laudande! epham, recepto

33. concines. We should rather
expect an emphatic ‘tu.' Cp. 2. 17. 50,
3. 17. 5. The ‘ego . .parvus’ of the
last stanzascontrastsnotonlywithPindar
before, but with Antonius ‘maiore
plectro’ who follows. We may note,
also, that part of tha contrast lies in tha
occasion. ‘Not now, neither you nor 1.
By and bye, whenever it is that Caesar
comes horne in triumph, a greater poet
than I shall sing his praises, and even I
(v. 45) shall find a voice in my delight’
‘Maiore plectro’ occupies a double
relation, as instmmental ablativa with
‘concines’ and descriptiva ablativa with
‘ poe'ta’; sea on 1. 3. 6. With the expres-
sion itself cp. ‘leviore plectro,' a. 1. 40,
‘aureo plectro: a. 13. 26.

The name was given to the slope by
which the ‘sacra via' descended from
the spot where its pavement is still
visible under the Arch of Titus, into the
Forum, a fall of 5 3 feet. Burn's Rome
and Campagna, p. 78.

Horace is speaking, at the moment, not
of shouting with the shouting mob, but
of singtng, ie. writing poetry; but there
is probably ametaphorical play in the
