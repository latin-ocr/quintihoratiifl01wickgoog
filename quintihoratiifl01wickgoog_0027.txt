[01 the origin uf the ‘cognomen' nothing can be guessed. The

gentile name from some member of the Horatia gens Itis now
more generally believed, on a suggestion of G. F. Grotefend, that it
was derived from the Horatia tribus, the one of the country tribes in
which the colony cf Venusia, was enrolled, and to which Horace's
father, as a libertus of Venusia, would belong]
