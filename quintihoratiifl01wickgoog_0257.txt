HORATII CARMINUM

Da lunae propere novae,

Da noctis mediae, da, puer, auguris
Murenae: tribus aut novem
, Miscentur cyathis pocula commodis
Qui Musas amat impares

Ternos ter cyathos attonitus petet
Vates; tres prohibet supra

Rixarum metuens tangere Gratia
Nudis iuncta sororibus.

Insanire iuvat: cur Berecyntiae
Cessant flamina tibiae?

Cur pendet tacita fistula cum lyra?
Parcentes ego dexteras

Odi: sparge rosas3 audiat invidus
Dementem strepitum Lycus

Et vicina seni non habilis Lyco,

9. lunae nova03 Od. 3. 23. a‘nas-
cente luna,' where see note. The‘ new
moon ' means apparently the first of the
mouth, on which a feast was usual, as
in Greek νουμηνία was transferred by
usage so completely from the first of
the natural lunar month to the first
of the calendar month, that the real
new moon was expressed hy νουμηνία
κατὰ τὴν σελήνην, Thuc. 2. 28. For
the genitive see on 3. 8. 13 ‘cyathos
amici sospitis!

10. noctis mediator 3. 28. 16.

11. Horace assumes the fonction oi
‘arbiter bibendi’ (Dict. Aut. sv. ‘sym- κ
posium’), and proceeds (not to give
orders to the servants, so there is no
need with Rutgers and Bentley to alter
‘miscentur’ to ‘miscentor‚' but) to an·
nounce to the guests the proportions in
which the wine and water are mixed.
It is a disputed point whether ‘cyathus'
was a name of the ladle used for mix·
ing: cp. Sat. 1. 6. 117. In any case it
was a measure of capacity, the twelfth
ofrhe sextarius, which was nearly equal
to our pint. The meaningwill therefore
be. that the wine and water may be
mixed in the proportion of 9 to 3 or
3to 9.

12. commodis is rendered by Orelli
‘integris' ‘ plenum modum habentibus?
after Plautus' ‘commodas minas‚' i. e.
of full weight ; but it is perhaps better

taken by Ritter as an adjective sor an
adverb, ‘to suit the taste of the drinkers.’

13-17. It is a question whether this
is a double description of the two
classes of drinkers spoken of in vv. 11,
12, the ‘rapt poet, with his love for the
Muses and their uneven number,’ who
ask ior nine parts of wine, and those
who think rather of the Graces and
their decorous fears of quarrek, and
therefore keep to three; or a further
statement about the one class who
prefer the stronger mixture, ‘They are
moved by two motives, their love of the
nimirums, which makes them ask for
the lull nine parts oswine, and their
regard for the decorous Grates, which
restrains them from taking the additional
three which would make the liquor
“merum''’. in the first case ‘tres
supra' (for their order cp. 5. 3. 11 ‘ quos
inter ’) must menn ‘more than three'3
in the latter case ‘three further.²
