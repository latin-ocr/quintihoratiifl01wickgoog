HORATII CARMINUM

Hic dies anno redeunte festus

Corticem adstrictum pice dimovebit

Amphorae fumum bibere institutae
Consule Tullo.

Sume, Maecenas, cyathos amici

Sospitis centurn et vigiles lucernas

Perfer in lucem :· procul omnis esto

Clamor et ira.
Mitte civiles super urbe curas:
Occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen.
Medus infestus sibi luctuosis·
Dissidet armis
Servit Hispanae vetus hostisorae
Cantaber sera domitus catena

9. hio dies, etc. ‘this day a holiday
in each returning year?

10. In order to ripen thewine sooner,
it was customary to construet the ‘apo-
theca’ in such a place as to be exposed
to the smoke and hot air of the bath
furnaces. This rendered it more neces-
sary carefully to protect the cork (as
here with a coating of pitch), lest the
flavour of the smoke should penetrate to
the wine. See Dict. Ant. s. v. ‘vinum’

11. bibere institutae, ‘which was
taught the' lesson of drinking?

12. consule runo, probably L.
Volcatius Tullus, who was consul in
nc. 66, the year before Horace's birth.
Cp. 3. 21. 1 ‘O nata mecum Consule
Manlio.' This was not an extreme age

(cp. 3. 14. 13 'Catium Marsi memorem

dnelli,' ie. asold as ae. 88), and the
occasion demands the oldest wine in the-
cellar. Another L. Volcatius Tullus
was consul with Augustus in ao. 33.
15. amini, the genitive of the person
in whose honour the cup is drunk. Cp.
3. 19. 9 foll. ‘Da lunae propere novae,
- Da noctis mediae, da, puer, auguris
Murenae' The custom and the con-
struction are Greek. Theoc. 14. 18
ἔδοξ’ ἔπιχεῖσθαι ἄκρατον “firrvos ἤθελ’
inantus, ἔδει μόνον ilvrvos εἰπῆν, Orelli
quotes also Antiph. in Athen. 10. 21
κυάθους θεῶν τε ani θεαινῶν μυρίους. This
illustratos also ‘centurn’ lor an inde-
finite number. Macleane, referring to
the custorn mentioned in Ov. Fast. 3.
531 foll. (¹ Sole tamen vinoque calent,
annosque precantur Quot sumunt calices

ad numerumque bibunt. Invenies illie
qui Nestoris ebibat annm, Quae sit por
calices facta Sibylla suos,')‚ thinks it is
equivalent to saying, ‘wish me a hundred
years of lira*

arfirgllfllers’ l? kiehthrl bllqllhll
lucemae'} Virg. Aeh’. 9. 338 ‘Aequasset
noctiludurninlucemquetulisset.' Orelli
contrasts the expression of Or. Her. 19.
195 ‘iam dormitante lucerna-⁹

15, 16. ‘it'shall be a sober and peace-
sul merrymaking'; no ‘impius clamor,'
1. ²7· 73 no ‘male ominata verba‚' 3.
14. 11. The purpose is apparently to
make more allnring to Maecenas the
contr-ast from the tumults and troubles
ol the city. Perhaps also to give sorne-
thing of a religious air to the banquet of
thanksgiving.

17. civiles =‘domestica5.’ opposed to
phe foreign questions of the following
mes.

19. Medus, ‘the Parthian’ ; see on
1. 2. 22. The point that the Mede's
whole ofsensive power is exhausted on
himself in intestine quarrels is brought
out by the position of ‘sibi’ standing
where it seems equally open to be
