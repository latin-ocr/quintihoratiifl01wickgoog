super urbe curas,’ ‘Tu civitatem quis deceat status Curas, et urbi
sollicitus times? These expressions have been usually interpreted of
the powers which Augustus is known to have delegated to Maecenas
during his own absence from Rome in the last year of the civil war.
Dio 51. 3, Tac. Anu. 6. 11 ‘Augustus bellis civilibus Cilnium illae-
cenatem equestris ordinis cunctis apud Romam atque italiam prae-
posuit' tf the later date of these Odes were adopted it would seem
necessary to assume, what is probable enough in itself, but not other·

during Augustus' absence in Gaul aud Spain in the years rac. 27-24.

IL-THE ORDER OF THE ODES.

ξ 9. lu the preceding pages lt has been assumed that the first three
Boohs of the Odes were published together. This is not a necessary
inference from Suetonius' words; ali that we know from him being
that three Books had been published before the fourth was corn·
menced. But if we may assume that the present division of Odes
between the Books is the original division, it will follow that the
publication of the three must have been simultaneous‚ not successive,
for, whatever be the principle of the arrangement of the Boolm, it
certainly is not chronological 1. For this reason, then, if forno other,

it may be a matter of some interest to see tlie evidence in favour of
the present order of the Odes. ’

§ 10. In the first place, it has at least the right of undisputed tradi·
tional possession. One MS. indeed, and that the important Berne MS,
ignores the division into BoolrS, and to some extent rearranges the
Odes; but we may notice (a) that the Fourth Book (which certainly
was separate), and even the Epodes, are treated in the same way as
the Odes of Books i-tti; (b) that a purpose can be probably assigned

¹ We have seen that 1. 24 dates from associated with 5. 1-6; 1. 26 tanges it·
the sarne year as 3. 143 1.12 seems to self with 3. 8, and this again is certainly
be one of the latest, 3. ²9 one of the prior to r. ao.
earliest Odes; 1. 52 is most plausibly
