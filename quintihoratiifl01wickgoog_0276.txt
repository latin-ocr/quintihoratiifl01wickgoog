Europa didn't know on what she was embarking, till she found herself on the scas

and saw nothing but sky and water. Then she repented bitteriy, till Venus con-
soled her.’

It is possible that the conclusion of Europa's story loses its immediate point
from our not knowing the circumstances of Galatea's Journey. Was she too, as
has been suggested, to find consolation in the wealth and greatness of tlte com·
panion of her travel? There is no passion, though there is tenderness and kindli-

’ ness, in the poet¹s feeling towards her. The Ode contra'sts in this respect with the
similar poems oi Propertius (1. 8) and Ovid (Am. a. 11).

ln any case Horace meant people to read his Ode who knew nothing of Galatea,
and the story of Europa makes an artistic whole, even if, as is so often the case in
Pindar's mythological episodes‚ it only touches at one point the subject with which
the Ode begins. The story of Europa is told in Ov. Met. a. 847 soil.
