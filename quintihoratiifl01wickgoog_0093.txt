HORATII CARMINUM

Et Musa cordi est. Hic tibi copia ²
Manebit ad plenum benigno

Ruris honorum opulenta cornu.
Hic in reducta valle Caniculae
Vitabis aestus et fide Teia

Dices laborantes in uno
Penelopen vitreamque Circen3
Hic innocentis pocula Lesbii
Duces sub umbra, nec Semeleius
Cum Marte confundet Thyoneus
Proelia, nec metues protervum
Suspecta Cyrum, ne male dispari

cornu, the horn 01 plenty. Ovid
