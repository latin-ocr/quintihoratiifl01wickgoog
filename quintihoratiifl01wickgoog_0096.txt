‘ bant cornua bombos.’

14. caecus, a physical characteristic
’ 01 the personified seli-love, as Conington
points out in a note on his Translation.

15. plus nimio, Od. 1'. 33. 1, Epp. 1.
to. 30. The order in prose is ‘nimio
plus,’ Cic. ad Att. 10. 8. u has been
explained: (ι) as a translation 01 ὑπερ-
άγαν, following the analogy 01 ‘pius
justo? etc, ‘more than that which is too
much'; (2) as following the analogy 01
‘plus pauio’ (‘a little too mucb') Ter.
Heaut. 2. 1. 8; ‘nimio validius: Plin.
24123 ‘nimio melius‚’ Plaut. Pers. 1.
3. 31, ‘by very much too much';
‘nimio’ being the ablativo or adverb
os measure. It is a colloquial phrase
common in Plautus, M. 0.,2. 6. 106,
Bacch. 1. 2. 42, and the combination in

Bacch. 4. 4. 21 ‘nimio minus, multo
parnm‚’ seems to show that the second
explanation was the true one: see a
collection of instances of ‘nimio’ with
compar. adj. in Rarnsay's ‘Mostellaria’
Excursus 12. It qualifies ‘tollens’
‘lifting sar too high’; witlsthis picture
cp. Ori. 3.16. 17 ‘Iure 'perhorrui Late
conspicuum tollere verticem.'

Gloria, 'vainglory‚' as in Epp. 1. 18.
22 ‘ Gloria quem supra vires et vestit et
ungit!

16. arcani Fides prodiga, an oxy·

moron, ‘Faith that blabs out her se· ,

cret’; cp. Od. 5. 24. 59 ‘periura fides?

perlucidior vitro, ‘with a window
in its mind,' Con. Compare the Greek
proverbs, ndronrppit eidone χαλκός ἔστ’
oinos δὲ νοῦ and τὸ ἐν καρδίᾳ τοῦ νήφοντος
ἐπὶ τῇ γλώσσῃ τοῦ perhorres, Hor. Epod.

ODE XIX.

‘I rnouenr my days 01 passion were over, but love and wine and idleness and
Glycera's beauty are too much for me. Again t feel the fpll power of Venus-
again must leave all other subjects to write love songs-again think only 01
propitiating Venus and moderating the pains 01 my passion?

See Introd. to Ode 4. 1, which Horace links to this Ode by repeating the

first line.
