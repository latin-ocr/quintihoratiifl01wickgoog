HORATII EPODON

EPODE ll.

Honaoa gives a point to his praises oi country life by putting them into the
mouth oi a money-lender notorious for his keenuess in his trade. Cp. the saying
attributed apparently to the same person. the ‘fenerator Alfius,’ by Columella (1. 7)
‘vel optima nomina non appellando fieri mala,’ ‘that the best debtors become bad
ones if you let them alone! There does not seem to be any attempt to make the
usurer speak in character through the poem; the pleasures named are those which
any Roman poet would have named, ep. Virg. G. a. 493 foll, Tibull. 1. 1 soll. It
is the irony of the conclusion which turns an Idyll into an Epode. Its point is
rather the strength of the ‘ ruling passion' (cp. the ⁶ mercator· of Od. 1. t. 16, who
in the storm ⁸ otium et oppidi Laudat rura sui: mox reficit rates Quassus ¹) than, as
has been suggested, the elaborate hypocrisy ola money-lender who makes his
panegyricon arustic lise an excuse lor pressing his debtors for repayment, wbile
he means all the while to put the money out to interest again at the next settle·
ment-day. ’

The diction of the Epode reminds us constantly of the Georgica

BEATUS ille, qui procul negotiis

Solutus omni fenore,

Neque horret iratum mare,

Forumque vitat et superba civium
Potentiorum limina.
