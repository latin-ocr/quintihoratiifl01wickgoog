'ODE XVI.

‘Parca is (at times at least) the prayer of all men, though they do not go the
rray to find it. Gold and purple will not buy it, Grosphus; neither wealth nor
rank banish care; and meantime very little suffices ior a happy life il the heart is
free from sear and desire„ Moderated desires, not hurrying from placeto place,
are the means to avoid care. Go where you will you cannot escape yourself. Care
boards the best appointed trireme and keeps up with the fleetest horseman, Enjoy
the present and don’t think ol the future. If troubles corne, smile and be patient
and they will be the lighter. Unmixed happiness is not to be looked ior: Achilles
had glory‚ but with it an early death; Tithonus a long ute and the weariness of
old age. What you lack Ι rnay perhaps have, as you haye what Ι lack. You
have flocks and herde and purple gannane, and Ι have my little farm, my muse,
and a heart to despise my critice.³

‘Peuce and happiness depend on ourselves, not on things outside os us.' ‘Quod
petis, hic est, Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit aequus‚’ Epp. r. 11. 29.
Grosphus is doubtless the person whom Horace commende to Iccius in Epp. r.
ra, 22-24:-
‘Utere Pompeio Grospho, et, si quid petet. ultro
Defer 3 nil Grosphus nisi verum orabit et aequum.
Vilis amicorum est annona, bonis ubi quid deest-⁹

“ We gather from this Ode that he was a man of wealth‚ and, from both Ode aud
Epistle, that his property was in Sicily.
