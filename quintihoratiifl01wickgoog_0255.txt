HORATII CARMINUM

Si tener pleno cadit haedus anno,
Larga nec desunt Veneris sodali
Vina craterae, vetus ara multo

Fumat odore.

Ludit herboso pecus omne campo,
Cum tibi Nonae redeunt Decembres; ιο
Festus in pratis vacat otioso
Cum bove pagus3
Inter audaces lupus errat agnos3
Spargit agrestes tibi silva frondes ;
Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor
Ter pede terram.

5. pleno anno, when the year is
nearly full, in Decembe13 or, perhaps,
only like ‘ per exactos annos‚' 3. 22. ὀι-
‘quotannis' at intervals of a full year.

6. Veneris sodali craterae, ‘the
bowl, Venus’ mate.' Orelli quotes an
address to a dagon, Βάκχου roi Μουσέων
thoph λάτρι καὶ Κυθερείηε, Perhaps it is
thus characterized as fitting the title
given to Faunus in v. 1. Ritter makes
⁶ craterae’ the genitive with ‘vina’ ⁶ wine
in ¹the bowl,' some particular bowl
known to be set lor Faunus and takes
‘Veneris sodali' of the god himself.

7. vetus implies that these rites
have been duly performed during many
generations, Macleane puts a full
stop at ‘craterae’ and makes the gen-
lelral description of the Fauualia begin

ere.

12. pagus. There is a curious ya-
riant in some ol the best MSS, ‘pardus‚'
the origin ol which Bentley ingeniously

traces to some moukish copyist, who
had in mind the prophecy of Isaiah.
11. 6‘Habitabit lupus cum agno et
pardus cum haedo accubabit?

14. spargit frondes. That the
leaves were still falling in December,
see Epod. 1-1. 5 ‘December . . silvis
honorem decutit?

agrestes, ‘a woodland carpet' of
leaves

15. invisam, ‘invisam terram fos-
soribus merito dixit quod in ea laborant
quum fodiunt‚' Porph.

pepulisse. For the perf. inf. with
‘gaudet' see on 3. 4. 513 he finishes
ofl each triple beat with a flourish, as
though he were dancing on an enemy.

fossorg Virg. G. 2. 264 ‘labefacta
movens robustus iugera fossor!

16. ier, of triple time. Cp. 4. 1. 28
‘In morem Salium ter quatient humum’
Perhaps Horace is offering an etymology
ol ⁶ tripudiare)
