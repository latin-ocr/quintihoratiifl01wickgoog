ODE XIX.

‘Coun Telephus, enough os your antiquarian lore; attend t'o the more practical
question where and when we are to sup this cold night? Theb, with a sudden
change, he sancies the banquet already prepared (cp. a, 7. 21 foll, 2. 11. 18 soll.)z
‘We have to drink the new mouth, and our friend Murena, the newlyelected
Augur. Strike up with pipe and harp; no grudging, scatter the roses. Let morose
old Lycus hear our riot next door, and his ill-matched young wile. We are better
matched here, Telephus and Rhodes and Glycera.¹ ’

Telephus is a mythologioal name which Horace used before in 1. 15 (see Introd.
to that Ode), and uses again in4‚ 11. 21. It is of course possible that areat
person is intended in rhis‘ case. though it is hard to see why his name should

be concealed. Ritter hits upon the rhetorieian Heliodorus, the companion os

Horace'sjourney to Brundisium (⁴ Graecorum longedoctissimus,’ Sat. 1. 5. 3), with
whose profession such antiquarian questions would suit, and whose name he fancies
to be etymologically played on iu ‘Telephus’ (τῆλε φάος).

For Murena see on 2, 2. 5 and 2. 10 lutrod.
