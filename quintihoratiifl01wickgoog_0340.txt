ODE XIV.

‘How can senate and people worthily honour thy virtueS, Augustus, and trans·
mit their mernory to all time? The triumphs of the Nero brothers, of Drusus over
the Vindelici, the Genauni and Breuni, ol Tiberius over the Raeti, are all owing to
thy auspices. How terrible was Tiberius in the parauit5 as the south wind on the
waters, or as the river Aufidus when it pours in a torrent from the hilis down on
the plain. Thine were the plan and provision of the campaign, thine its divinely·
ordered success, sor the victory came on a day already noteworthy for thy happy
fortune-just fifteen years after the capture of Alexandria. Thy reign has been
a series ol triumphs, and now all the world isat thy ieet.'

For some account os Tiberius' campaign in ac. 15 see Introd. to the Book.
