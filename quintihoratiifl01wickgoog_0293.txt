which joins the Rhine opposite Bonn. Lollius met thern and suffered
adescat, which, though Suetonius makes less of it (‘ maioris infamiae
quarn detrimenti,' Aug. 23) is ranked by Tacitus with that of Varus
(Ann. 1. 10). At any rate it was sufficient to make Augustus set out
in person from Rome. Before, however, he reached the frontier, the
Sygambri, finding that Lollius was rallying his forces, and that rein·
forcements were on their way from Rome, made a hasty peace, and
retired again beyond the Rhine. See Dio 54. ao. Augustus remained

2. In the meantime, in the year 15, an important and permanent
conquest had been affected by Tiberius and Drusus, the sons ol
Livia, by her former husband Ti. Claudius Nero. Merivale recounts
(vol. iv, ch. 34, p. 142) the operations by which secure possession was
gained by Rome in Augustus' reign of the western passes of the Alps
the Corniche Road, the passes that lead from France to Tutin, an'd
the St. Bernard passes into the Val d' Aosta. The work of Tiberius
and Drusus was directed to the similar object of obtaining military
command of the more eastern passes into the valleys of the Rhine
and the Inn, which were still unsafe lor the armies of Rome or her
allies and from which the mountain-tribes even issued from time
to time to plunder Italian soil. Drusus forced what is now known
as the Brenner pass, meeting and overthrowing the Rhaetians in
the valley near Tridentum, now Trent. In the meantime, or as
soon as Drusus' success was assured‚ Tiberius was detached from
Augustus’ army in Gaul, with the purpose of taking the enemy in the
rear. He ascended the Rhine valley to the Lake of Constance,
where he launched a flotilla os boats, and entering at once several
of the valleys which open on the lake, ‘penetrated the gorges of the
Upper Rhine and Inn in every direction, so that at the conclusion
of a brilliant and rapid campaign, the two brothers had affected the
complete subjugation of the country of the Grisons and the Tyrol!

history, only to disappear again for a thousand years! illerivale‚
