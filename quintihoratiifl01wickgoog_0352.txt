‘Perorsos and Diana, grant the prayers duly offered at this sacred season (v.
1-8).

Ο sun, ever changing yet ever the same, let Rome's pre-eminence be as change·
less (v. 9-12).

Diana, birth goddess, guard our mothers (v. 13-16).

Bless our new marriage laws to the increase of our people‚ that each “seculum ’¹
may find us still celebrating this festival (v. 1744).

Ο Destinies‚ fulfil the happy macies, and add future to past blessings; fertility
oi earth and cattle; seasonable rain and pure air (v. 25-32).

Apollo, heatus boys (v. 33, 54).

Diana, hear us girls (v. 35. 56).

If Rome is your creation, the temnant sdred from Troy sor Aeneas’ piety‚ give
our youth Aeneas' manners, and our old men his happy old age. Give Rome all
blessings (v. 37-48).

And grant the prayers now offered by Aeneas’ great son. He has subdued
the Mede, the Scyth, the Indian. He has restored peace and virtue aud plenty
(v. 49-60).

Phoebus pleased with his Palatius temple, promises another lustrum and in·
arcasing years of prosperity (v. 61-68).

Diana listens to the ‘⁶ quindecimviri,” aud the chorus of boys and girls3 and all
the gods approve and join in their blessing' (v. 69-76).

That there was some division of parts between the male and female singers
seems probable on the sace of the Ode, and the Sibyllino verses (v. ao) seem
to speak definitely of such a division. It is not so easy to see what the division
was. Steiner otranges the Ode as follows :-- ,

¹ Str. 1. 2, proodus, boys and girls together.

str. 16-19‚ epodus, boys and girls together.
Ritter ¹ameuds this arrangement by assigning 10-12 to the boys, 13-15 to the
girls; 16 to the boys, answered to by 17 from the girls. Then in 18 the girls
begin, and would be answered in a similar way by the boys, but this is changed into

a final strophe by the united choir.
There are obvious difficulties in the way of both.
