LIB. III. OD. 29. ·

Prudens futuri temporis exitum
Caliginosa nocte premit deus
Ridetque‚ si mortalis ultra
Fas trepidat. Quod adest memento
Componere aequus3 cetera fluminis
Ritu feruntur, nunc medio alveo
Cum pace delabentis Etruscum .
In mare, nune lapides adesos ’
Stirpesque raptas et pecus et domus
Volventis una non sine montium
Clamore vicinaeque silvae,
Cum fera diluvies quietos
Irritat amnes, Ille potens sui
Laetusque deget, cui licet in diem
