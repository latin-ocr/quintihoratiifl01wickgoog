EPODE Vi

Cnnrnrn, with her crew of witche5‚ Sagana, Veia, and Folia, is engaged iu the
task of drawing to her, by spells of magio, a miserable old man named Varus. vv.
1-10‚ the poem opens with the terrified prayers of a boy, who sees dimly that
the hags have some dreadful intent, though he knows not what. 11-14, he is
stripped and setin the midst to await their further purposes. 1544, Canidia gives
her orders for the brewing of the magic bowl. 2548, Sagana sprinkles the house
with water from Avernus. a9u40, Veia, meanwhile, is digging in the garden
a bole where, is this spell proves insufficient, the boy is to be buried up to his chin,
aud left to starue, that his marrow and liver may be ingredients in a more potent
philtre. 41-46‚ Folia plays her part in the incantation. What it was is left to
our imaginati0n; we are only told of her power—she could draw the moon and
’ stars from the sky. 47-60, Canidia. half afraid already that her spella are not
successful, appeals to the powers that witness her blaok arts, that her beloved <an
old fop‚ on whom she is made to pour contempt in her very prayer) may corne to
her. 61-8a ‘he comes not; what has happened? No herb has been omitted,
nothing that could make him forget other charms. Aha! she sees it all. He is
under the spell of some more skiliul witch. He shall not get off, however. She
has a stronger charrn yet to try, and heaven and earth shall change places before
she lets his love go? 85-10a the boy understands her, and interrupta the scene
with a burst of despair, in which he threatens his torturers with the wengeance of
spirits and men.

The scene is laid in the interiores a house in Rome, apparently in the Subura;
see on vv. 25, 30, 58. A misunderstanding os v. 43, led Porph. to lay the scene at
Ἴ Naples.
