ODE Xll.

‘Wnnr man wilt thou sing os, Clio? what demigodl what godi-sing of, till
the hill ol Helicon rings his name again, or the woods of Haemus follow to listen,
as they did when Orpheus sang? What god, but Jove first, aud Pallas next, Liber
Diana, Phoebus. For demigods‚ Hercules and the Twin Brethren yvho calm the
stormy sea. And of meu: Romulus and all the Roman worthies.; Marcellae, the
lustre of whose name grows with each generation; the Julian house, which out-
shines all others as the moon outsbines the stars; Augustus, the hope ol the
human race, the vicegerent os Jove himself!

The frameworlr oi the Ode is suggested by the opening of Pind. 01, az·-

ὰναξιφόρμιγγεε ὕμνοι
riva θεόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν;

nut after the question has been asked the resemblance ceyses.'1n Pindar it is
answered immediately: ‘The god is Zeus, the hero Hercules, the man Theron‚'
and all three are directly connected with the Olympian victory which Theron
has woh.

On the date of this Ode, sec Introd. to Odes i-iii. ξ 2. · ’

The arguments as to the latest time at which it can have been written or
published seem irresistible. It cannot have been alter Marcellus' untimely death
in the autumn of uc. 23. The earliest date is commonly fixed by his marriage with ν
Julia in ac. 25, when Augustus adopted him as his son. The Ode links his name
too closely to the Julian house to have been written before Augustus had given
final and unmistalrable proofs of his intentioris towards him.
