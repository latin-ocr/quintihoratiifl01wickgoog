HORATII CARMINUM

O DE XVII.

‘Kun me not, Maecenas, with your dismal forebodings 1f you are going to die,
1 die too ς so the gods will, and so 1 will, For mysels‚1 could not survive theone
half of myself: 1 have swern, and will be true to my oath os fealty; where you go
Ι will go, if the Chimaera or Gyas were to rise to prevent it. And rba gods will
it too. I know not whetherl was born under a good star or a bad one, but my
horoscope tallias worrderiully with yours. You recovered from dangerous illness

just when Iescaped the falling tree. let us rernember it, and in our several ways
thank tlre gods)

Maecenas was an invalid (Plin. N. H. 7, 54 ‘Quibusdam perpetua febris est
sicut C. Maecenati. Eidem triennio supremo nullo horae momento contigit sorn-
nus’)‚ and one that clung passionately to lire, if we may trust his own lines
preserved by Seneca, Epp. 101 :-

‘Debilem facito manu,
Debilem pede, coxa,
Tuber adstrue gibberum,
Lubricos quate dentem
Vita dum superest, bene estl
Hanc mibi vel acuta
Si sedeam cruce, sustine?

He has been complaining of his healtlr to Horace, and the poet would coax him
out of his hypochondriacal fears by the expressions of affection, by the professions
oi his own strong belief that Maecenas’ lile is as good as his own, by recalling his
previous reeovery from illness and his flattering reception in the theatre, as
memories likely to strengthen his confidente in his destiny and in himself.

The astrological part of the Ode is only an adaptation of the language of a
popular superstition which Horace condemns in Od. 1. rr. Orelli points out that
the language of stanna 5, ‘seu Libra seu,’ etc, forbids the idea that Horace had
confidence in any calculation ol his own horoscope. He tells us, Sat. Ι. 6, 114,
that he was fond of standing and listeniug to the astrologers of the circus, With
the poet's professions of his resolution not to survive Maecenas cp. Epod. 1; on
Maecenas' reception in the theatre‚ Od. 1. ao, and on Horace's own escape from
the falling tree, Od. a. 13.

ἱ Maecenas actually died in ac. 8, aiew months before Horace.

CUR me querelis exanimas tuis?
Nec dis amicum estnec mihi te prius
Obire, Maecenas, mearum ,
Grande decus columenque rerum.

a. amioum est, φίλον ἐστί. decus meum? Cp. Epp. 1.1. 105, Virg.
