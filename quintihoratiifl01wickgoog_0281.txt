HORATII CARMINUM

Crede veloci, nisi herile mavis
Carpere pensum,

Regius sanguis dominaeque tradi

Barbarae pellex. Aderat querenti

Perfidum ridens Venus et remisso

Filius arcu.

Mox, ubi lusit satis: Abstinet0‚

Dixit, irarum calidaeque rixae,

Cum tibi invisus laceranda reddet
Cornua taurus.

Uxor invicti Iovis esse nescis:

Mitte singultus, bene ferre magnam

Disce fortunam3 tua sectus orbis
Nomina ducet.

64. carpere pausum, Prop. 4. 3. 15
‘tristes sua pensa ministrae Carpebant,
medio nebat et ipsa loco,’ of maidens
carding their ‘weighed portions' of wool
lor the mistress to spin.

65. sanguim 2. 20. 6, 4. a. 13, C. S.

49d6. barbarae, ‘loreigu‚' as though a
Greek, aud not a Tyrian, were talking.

Cp. Conington on Virg. Aen. 2. 504.
The ‘pellex ⁹ will be at the command oi
the native queen, as Cassandra at Cly·
temuaestra's in the Agam.

67. perfidum rideus3 1. aa. 23, 2.
12. 14, z. 19. 6. Her‘smile of trea-
chery' is partly at the success ol the
device which has beguiled Europa;
partly (the emphasis being rather on
‘ridens’ which comesto some extent
παρὰ προσδοκίαν), with a more playful

meaning. at Europa's misplaced grief,
which she is about to allay. Cupid has
his bow unstruug, to show that his
work is over.

69. abstineto irarum see on 2. 9.
1 .

771. euru, ‘since' Venus repeats
Europa’s words in vv. 45 foll: ‘You
shall see him who was the bull again,

and you shall have the power to tear ·

his horus as you wished, if you still
desire it!

75. uxor esse nescis. Either the
Greek construction lor ‘uxorem te esse
uescis’ ; or, as Orelli prefers, = ⁴ tanquam
uxorem te gerere nescis,’ tyou knownot
how to play the wife!

75. sectus orbis, ‘half the world?

76. nomina, plural, as 4. a. 3‘da·
turus nomina ponto’
