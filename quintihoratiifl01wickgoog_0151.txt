HORATII CARMINUM

ODE Ill.

‘Lar the thought of death moderate both repining in trouble and exultation in
prosperity. Enjoy yonrsell while you may, for death is at hand, ior rich and noble
as well as sor poor and humbiy born? ’

Some little doubt hangs over the name os the person to whom these counsels
of Epicureanisrn are addressed. The old Blandinian MS. gave it as ‘Gellius’
Cruquius identifies him with L. Gellius Publicola, the brother (half brother
through their mother Polla, or brother by adoption, according to different theories)
of Messalla (Ori. 3. 21. 7), and consul rac. 36.

Dellius (as the other good MSS. and the MSS. of Aer. and Porph write the
name) would probably be Q. Dellius, who had changed sides so osten that
Messalla is said to have nichnamed him ‘Desultor bellorum civilium? He had
deserted successively Dolabella, Cassius, and finally Antony on the eve of the
battle oi Actium. Gellius’ character was not such that Horace would gain much
by the substitution of his name for that cf Dellius
