HORATII EPODON

EPODE Vll.

‘Is civil war to be renewed, and Roman blood to flow again, not for the destruc-
tion of a foreign enemy, but todo the Parthian’s work and destroy Rome itself?
Even wild beasts do not prey on their own kind. Does anger blind you, or fate

to us from the death of Remus!

There is nothing to fix with precisiou the date of the Epode, It expresses horror

underlies the mythological form of such poems as Od. 1. 2. Compare in this respect,
as in othere, Epod. 16, which belongs to the same period.

Sed ut secundum vota Parthorum sua
Urbs haec periret dextera? ιο
