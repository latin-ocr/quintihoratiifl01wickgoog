ODE X. f

‘Tun wise sailor is neither tempted too iar out to sea nor frightened on to rocks
and shallows. One who has learnt to love the golden mean neither has a hovel
with a roos falling in nor a palace that would attract the evil eye. The higher the

¹seat the greater the fall. The wise man is prepared for fortune to change like
everything else. Be breve and hopeful is things are against you, and so, too, do
not spread all your sails because the wind chances to be favourable.'

Horace recommends moderatiori os lise and manners. Professedly it is a mean
that he praise53 bnt it is clear throughout that tt is excess that he depreeates; the
danger of desert is not really before his mind. This is shown in th'e first part os
the Ode ΒΥ omission-the hypothesis would require a stanza corresponding to st. 3
to illustrate the danger os being too low, as that illustratesthe danger oi being too
high-in the second part by the stress laid on the alternative least contemplated,
under cover of which the poet at last ventures to put plainly the lesson on which
his heart is really set.

The person to whom the Ode is addressed is the same as the ‘augur Murena' of
Od. 3.19. 11 (see also Sat. 1. 5. 38). He is variously called ‘Lucius Murena'
(Veli. Pat. 2. 91), ‘Licinius Murena’ (Dio Cass. 54. 3), ‘Varro Murena' (Suet.
Tib. 8), and he is said by Dio (1. c.) to haue been the brother os Terentia, the
wife of Maecenas, There is one of Cicero's friends who is called A. Varro (ad
Fam. 16. 12, see note in Watson's Select Letters‚ p. 305) and Varro Murena (ad
Fam. 13. 22). The friend ol Horace has been sometimes identified with the friend
eiCicero, sometimes taken to be his son. The double set of names must imply
that their beaten or, if there were two, the elder bearer of them, had passed by
adoption from one ‘gens' to the other.

The ‘ Murena’ os Horace had been employed by Augustus in ae. 25, in the sub-
jugation oi the Salassi, the inhabitants ol the Val d'Aosta, and had been namedias
Consul Suffectus in 23. In 22 he was accused, εἴτ’ οὗν davida εἴτε rol ἐκ διαβολῆς
