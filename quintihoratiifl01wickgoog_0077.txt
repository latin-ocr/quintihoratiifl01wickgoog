44 HORATII CARMINUM

Arte materna rapidos morantem
Fluminum lapsus celeresque ventos
Blandum et auritas fidibus canoris

² Ducere quercus.
Quid prius dicam solitis parentis
Laudibus, qui res hominum ac deorum,
Qui mare ac terras variisque mundum

Temperat horis Ρ

Unde nil maius generatur ipso,
Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum:
Proximos illi tamen occupavit

Pallas honores,

Proeliis audax neque te silebo
Liber ct saevis inimica Virgo

E9. arte materna, Calliope's, Virg.
11. blandum dooere, App. 2. ς a.
13. dicam, a usual word with Ho-

race for ‘canera’ ‘praedicare' cp. Od.

1.17.19‚1.19.12,1.21.1‚3.4.r.etc.
parentis, ‘the sire’ of gods and men.

This is the reading of the oldest MSS..

though both V and A have also a v. l.

‘parentium' which is found in many

MSS. and vvas read by the Comm.

Cruq. ‘Parentum’ might be construed

with ‘laudibus’ as the genitive either of

the subject (as it is taken by Comm.

Cruql, ‘ the hymn of praise ascribed by

our fathers.' or of the object, ‘the

praises ascribed to our fathers.¹ In the
first c'ase,though the construction would
not run as smoothly as it does with

‘parentis' there would be no alteration

in the order oi the thought. We should

still be answering the question, ‘Quem
deum'? But the second rendering
makes ‘Quid dicam’? not part of an
answer, but a new question: ‘What
can corne before the praise of our fore·
fathers ’i ‘The praise of Jupiter! We
do not expect to go through a list of
gods, and then to answer the question,
‘Quem heroa ¹? before we corne to any
further allusion to the ‘parentes’ It is
not even as if the ‘laudes parentum'
were the maio subject of the Ode,
worthy to be named now though they
are necessarily postponed for a time.
They are only to be parts of a climax

which reads up to Augustus. But the
idea that the purpose was simply ‘to
praise famous men and our fathers that
begat us’ would naturally suggest ‘pa-
rentum' to a copyist who did not read
on, or view the Ode as a whole. With
the ‘Quid prius dicam ’i chirg. E. 3.
60 ¹ Ab Iove principium, Musae,’ Theoc.
17. 1; and for the whole order of the
objeets of the poet's praises. ep. 415.
28-32 ‘deos . ,virtute functos duces..
Progeniem Veneris!

¹4· qui ree, etc.. Virg. Aen. 1. 230
‘Oqui res hominumque deumque Aeter-
nis regis imperiis.'

15. mundum, surrounding space.

16. horis, like the Gr. ὥραις, ‘sea-
sous'; so again A. P. 300 ‘sub verni
temporis horam'

17. unde, ‘from whom,’ of a person,
Od. 1. 28. 28, Sat. 1. 6. 12, 2. 6. 21.
The Schol. quote Virg. Aen. 1. 6 ‘genus
unde Latinum! Cp. the use of ‘ undi-
que.’ Od. 1. 7. 7.

seeundum, Cic. Brut. 47 ‘nec enim
in quadrigis eum secundum numeraverim
aut tertium qui vix e-carceribus exierit
curn palmam iarn primus acceperit?

21. proeliis audax. Bentley, foi·
lowed by Rider, puts the stop after
instead of before these words, making
them an epithet of Pallas who is pre·
eminentiy ‘Armipotens' ‘Bellipotens’
etc. But Bacchus is ‘idem pacis medi-
usque belli¹ in Od. 2. 19. 28.

22. Virgo, Diana, the huntress.
