HORATIl. CARMINUM

Audis quo strepitu ianua, quo nemus s
Inter pulchra satum tecta remugiat
Ventis et positas ut glaciet nives
Puro numine Iuppiter?
Ingratam Veneri pone superbiam,
Ne currente retro funis eat rota.
Non te Penelopen difficilem procis
Tyrrhenus genuit parens,
O· quamvis neque te munera nec preces
Nec tinctus viola pallor amantium
Nec vir Bieriapellice saucius
Currat, supplicibus tuis
Parcae, nec rigida mollior aesculo
Nec Mauris animum mitior anguibus

ν5. nemus. This is usually taken of παροιμίαν ἀπορρήξωμεν πάνυ retractat τὸ

some public plantation, perhaps the
‘duo luci' (Liv. 1. 8), between the two
tops of the Capitoline.

6. inter pulchra taeta, *Though we
are not in the· Scythian witds, and

though you are comfortably lodged, yet

the wind howls outside as loudly aud the
frost bites as keenly.'

7. ventis. Bentley wished to alter
to ‘sentis' in order to avoid the double
ablative ‘strepitu’ ‘ventis’ and the

· rather harsh zeugma by which ⁶ audis'

is constructed with ‘ut glaciet nives!
But compare 1. 14. 6 and Virg. Aen. 4.
490 ‘mugire videbis Sub pedibus terrain
et descendere montibus ornos?

8. puro numine. ‘Numen' is
divine power in exercise; ‘numine
“ glaciet nives,’ as Virg. hen. 4. 269
‘caelum et terras qui numine torquet!
‘Puro,'ofaclear sky, as‘Iuppiteruvidus,’
‘frigidus’ etc. The ancients had ob·
served that cold is greater with a cloud-
less sk.

10. iLest rope and wheel run back
together! Clearly a proverbial expres-
sion, though the origin is uncertain.
The best illustration is that quoted srom
Lucian: or) δὲ πάνυ χαλεπὴ ἀεὶ τῷ dv-
θρώπῳ γεγένησαι, καὶ ὅρα μὴ κατὰ τὴν

112. ‘Your father was a Tuscan; you
are no Penelope to resist snitors.’ For
the form cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 4² ‘non me
tibi Troia Externum tulit!

Tyrrhenus, perhaps only ‘we know
all about you; you must not set up lor
more than you are? But the Etruscans
seem to have had a bad name sor luru-
rious living.

14. tinctus viola pallor, generally
interpreted like Virg. E. a. 48 ‘pallentes
violas‚' of the yellow violet. It appears
to have been taken so by Calpurnius
(Eci. 9. 40) of an unhappy lover, ‘Paui-
dior buxo violaeque simillimus erro.'
But the words themselves more natur-
ally suggest Ritter's interpretation, ‘sub-
lividus' ol a pale sace scored with dark
lines under the eyes.

15. Pieria, irorn the borders ol Ma-
cedlonia and Thessaly, as ‘Thressa
Ch oe.¹

17. rigida aesculo, seems to bea
continuante ot the image ol ‘curvat'
‘You are as hard to bend as an oak
bough.
