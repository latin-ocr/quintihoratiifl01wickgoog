¹ Olim iuventas et patrius vigor*

Vernique iam nimbis remotis·

5. olim seems to answer‚ as Ritter
thinks, to ‘iarn' ‘moin’ ‘nunu' which
mark stages in the young bird's progress;
so thatit will mean 111101, ‘long ago,’ and
is defined by · laborum inscium,’ ‘ere yet
he knew lise's labours.’ It is otherwise
taken as merely generalising-ulerdv
’ τινα, ποτε’; see on Epod. 5. 1.

iuventas et patrius vigor, ‘his
young blood and the force of his racc?

6. propulit. So Cruq. on the au-
thority os two 01 his Eland. MSS, and
it is accepted by all recent editors: the
larger number 01 MSS. have ⁴ protulit!
The time 01 1110 perfect tenses is that of
the Greek aorist in similes.

7. verni. Bentley t'eels strongly the ¹

objection raised byJul. Caes. Scaliger,
that eaglets are not harched till late 111
the spring, and would not be fit to fly
far till autumn. He prefers ‘vernis'
which has some MS. support, and which
he judges to have been 1110 reading 01
Acron, from his illustration ‘ut “ruit
imbriferum ver’'.' Probably ‘nimbis'
remotis’ is enough to account for the
Scholiast's quotation; the sound and
balance 01 the sentence are in favour 01
‘verni' We need not expect Horace to
date the eaglet’s growth with the accu-
racy of an ornithologist. He is more
likely 10 use the epithet ‘vernus' ina
pleasing sense of the soft breezes, than 111
association merely with storms. ‘Verni'
need not mean the first days 01 spring,
nor is the englet said yet to be fit 101·
hunting; it is of the first stage 111 the
art 01 flying. For a conj. alteration 01
Horace's text on somewhat similar
grounds see 1. 23. 5.

10. vividus impetus, 01 the actual
rusb, swoop, 01 his descent3 ‘demittit
impetus aquilam'=‘ aquila cum impetu
defertur.' tt has also been taken of his

impetuous temper; but it suits Horace's
economy os words, that tbe motive in
this clause should be gathered froin
the ‘ amor dapis atque pugnae' (a dainty
banquet¹ with the excitement of fighting
for itl tf the second clause, the mode
01 attack 111 that clause from the ⁶ vividus
impetus’ 01 this, as the unresisting weak-
ness of the sheep is lest to be inferred
from the epithet given to the serpents.

11. dracones. For the favourite
image of a battle between 011 engle and
a serpent cp. Hom. 11. 12. 100 foll,
Aesch. Cho. ²47 foll, Soph. Ant'. 125.

14. fulvae matris ab ubere. Some
awkwardness has been felt' in this ex-
pression, as, if we construet it with
‘depulsum' either ⁶ ab ubere' or ‘lacte'
would seem 10 be redundant (cp. Virg.
E. 7. 17 ‘depulsos a lacte‚' G. 3.187
‘depulsus ab ubere matris ')‚ and various
modes 'of treatment have been suggested.
‘Ubere ⁵ has been taken as an epithet 01
‘lacta’ ¹but this is t'o transfer the redun-
dancy from the expression tothethonght:
or, again, ‘fulvae matris ab ubere ' has
been referred to the hind (Ritter), but it
is hard to see how this adds to the pic·
ture; the youth 01 the lion is in point.
and the preoccupatiou 01 the 1111111, but
we clo not want in any way t'o under·
value Drusus* foes. Bentley led the way
01 conjecturari emendation, ‘iarn mane'
or ‘iarn sponte‚' and has been followed
by many others. The simplest method
is to separate ‘ab ubere' to 001100011-
tent from ‘depulsum' aud to take it in
the sense 01 ‘fresh from¹ his mother’s
teatsss Cp. ‘a matre pulli,’ Columrh,
‘recens a vulner·e,' Virg. Aen. 6. 450 ;
the place of Virgil’s ¹ recens’ is supplied
by the more definite ‘lacte depulsum! .
