, LIB. Ι. OD. 35.

Te semper anteit saeva Necessitas
Clavos trabales et cuneos manu
Gestaris 'atina nec severus
Uncus abest liquidumque plumbum

gloss as this of Acron's, which had
really been meant to interpret ‘anteit'
‘Anteit’ does not seem to require
‘serva' As Bentley pointed out, it is
not a technical term which might be
needed to complete a picture. The
‘anteambulones' or ‘antepedes’ were
not ordinarily slaves (Becker's Gallus,
Exc. B), but poor clients or friends who
rarr before their patron to clear the way
sor him. ‘Servi’ or ‘ancillae’ would
rather follow behind, as ‘pedisequi' or
‘pedisequae' Doom is made to wall<
before Fortuae, probably rather because
Hope and Loyalty go by her side or
after her than for the sake of any defi-
nite picture from Roman lif . On the
other hand, ‘Necessitas’ seems to want
an epithet as in the corresponding pas·

saga (q. ul, od. 3. 24· 6 ‘Si figit ada· -

mantinos Summis verticibus dira Neces-
sitas Claros? The nails, etc. belong to
Necessitas: they are not carried by
her for Fortuna. We do not 'wish, even
if it were possible. to make too perfect
an image os the processioa. The details ·
oi one part of it are not really con-
gruous with those of another. ‘Doom
goes before the steps· of Fortuner
Doom, whose handiwork man cannot
undo.' We want every word that we
can spare to heighten the picture of
Doom. Her relation to Fortnne is
lightly passed over.

are used to fix beams. In a like sym-
bolic sense, Cic. Verr. a. 5. 21 ‘Ut hoc
beneficium quemadmodum dicitur clavo
trabali figeret,¹ i. e. ‘ut ratum ac firmum
faceret? ’

cuneos, ‘wedgeshaped nails.’ Cic,
who translates from Aesch.. speaks of

blocks of stone, such as the joinrs 'os'a

which Necessitas carries are all em·
blems ,of the fixity of her sentence.
The point is not-that they are imple-
ments of building, bnt that they are the
implements which make a 'building in·
dissolnble. Others besides her may be
supposed to be planning and building,

There isa well-known criticism on
this stanza in a note (30) to Lessing’s
Laocotin. It seemed to him an instance
in which poetry had suffered from inas
tention to the laws which distinguish its
functions from those of painting. It is

and in the meantime, as ‘Necessitas’
would be in itself merely an unnamed
female figure, they would be necessary
