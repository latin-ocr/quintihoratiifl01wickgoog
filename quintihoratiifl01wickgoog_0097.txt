HORATII CARMINUM

Et lasciva Licentia

Finitis animum reddere amoribus,
Urit me Glycerae nitor

Splendentis Pario marmore purius:
Urit grata protervitas

Et voltus nimium lubricus adspici.
In me tota ruens Venus

Cyprum deseruit, nec patitur Scythas
Et versis animosum equis

Parthum dicere nec quae nihil attinent.
Hic vivum mihi caespitem, hic

verbenas, pueri, ponite thuraque
Bimi cunr patera meri:

. Mactata veniet lenior hostia.

3. Licentia, ‘freedom of i'fe‚' as Ca-
tullus, 51. 15, traces his passion to
'otium’ ‘Otium Catulle tibi molestum
est etc.

5. nitor, Od. 3. 12.5 ‘Liparaei nitor
Hebri* ‘bright beauty.’

8. lubricus, a face to loolr on which
is to siip from your resolve. The meta-
¹phorical use of ‘lubricus' in the sense
of ‘hazardous' is common in Cicero.
For the infin. see App¹ 2. t 2.

10. The Scythiam, with tlte Parthians
and the Spaniards, represent to Horace
the foreign politice of the time, the glory
that Angustus’ arms were always about “
to win or had won, cp. Ori. a. 11. 1, 3. 8.
16, eto, and introd to Odes i-iii. §s 7, 8.

11. versis equis, Od. a. 13. 18 ‘sa-
gittas et celeris fugam Parthi’; Virg. G.
3. 31‘Fidentemque fuga Parthum ver·
sisque sagittis.’

12. nso quae nihil attinent, ‘nor
titttt,finititimae? itt
he does not add such a qualification
may be possibly meant to show that he
is already absorhed in the thoughts of
love; heis no longer speaking of them
from outside.

15. vivum caespitem, a fresh cut

ἱ
l

turs for a temporary altar. Od. 5. 8. 4
‘acerra thuris Plena . . positusque carbo
in Caespite vivo?

14. verbenas, Od. 4. 11. 16 ‘ara
castis vincta verbenis’; Virg. Aen. ta.
rao ‘verbena tempora vincti ’; Virg. E.
8. 65 ‘verbenas adole pingues et mascula
thura.¹ Explained (by Servius on Virg.
Aen. l. c., Donatus on Ter. Andr. 4.13. 11,
and Acron on this place) as the name
oi all green things, boughs or 'leaves of
myrtle, bay. olive, etc„ or even grass
gathered ‘ex puro loeo’ and used in a
religious rite. The quotations given
show that they were used sor several
purposes in a sacrifice.

15. bimi. New wine was used in
sacrifices, cp. Od. 1. 31. a, 5. 23. 33
‘bimi’ will therefore probably mean
‘last year's wine‚’ which would be used
till the wine of the year was ready.

meri, mne with any admixture of
water was unfit for religious uses. Fest.
s. v. ‘spurcum’

16. veniet lenior, opposed to ‘ in me
tota ruens,' v. 9. The overpowering and
painful ‘afflatus' of a god was a sign of
disfavour rather than of favour, and
would be mitigated by submissiora and
reverence. See Od. 2. 19.
