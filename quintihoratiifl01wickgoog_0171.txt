HORATII CARMINUM

Divisus obiect0, remittas
Quaerere nec trepides in usum
Ἴ Poscentis aevi pauca. Fugit retro
Levis iuventas et decor, arida
Pellente lascivos amoros
Canitie facilemque somnum.
Non semper idem fioribus est honor
Vernis neque uno Luna rubens nitet
Voltu: quid aeternis minorem
Consiliis animum fatigas?
Cur non sub alta vel platano vel hac
Pinu iacentes sir: temere et rosa
’ Canos odorati capillos,
Dum licet, Assyriaque nardo

Potamus uncti? Dissipat Euius
Curas edaces, Quis puer ocius
Restinguet ardentis Falerni
Pocula praetereunte lympha? 20
