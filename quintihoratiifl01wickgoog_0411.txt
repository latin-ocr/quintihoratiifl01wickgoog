special relation more exactly than is possible vvith the caseless inlini·
tive. Thus ve find with the infinitive, ‘studeo' Cic. ; ‘nitor,’ Nep. ;
‘quaero,' Cic. ; ‘tendo,' Liv. ; ‘perg0,' Cic, ‘ persever0,' Cic. Many
verbs hesitare between the two constructions, ‘statuo facere’ or ‘ut
faciam‚' ‘prohibeo lacere’ or ‘quominus facias! The poets go
beyond the prose writers iu this extension, greatly because their
diction substitutas more highly-coloured and metaphorica} verbs for
the simplet ones of prose, ‘gaudeo’ ί2211οξ12111οξ ‘ardeo' for ‘ volo,'
etc. 3 but Livy and Sallust anticipate some of the boldest poetical
applications of this liberty.

It seems useless to seelr a full explanation of each case in the
doctrine that the infinitive was truly a substantive, which involves
the further difficulty that vve must explain in what relation (or ‘ease ')
it stands 10 the leading verb (see Conington's note on Virg. G. 1. 213).
A Roman poet felt at once the influence of Greek usage, in which
the infinitiva never lost its substantival character, andos Latin prece-
dents, which, if they may be traced ultimately to a similar source, had
yet ceased to be coloured hy any consciousness of it. That the infi-
nitive is treated at times by Horace as a substantive is clear lrom
such sentences as ‘dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,' and from its
coniunctiora witha substantive in the instances quoted below from
Od. 2. 16. 39, Epp. 1. 19. 9.
