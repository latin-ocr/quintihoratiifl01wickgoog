xx INTRODUCTION.

more or less skillul, to fill up a gap in the original authority, and
this once believed, a scholar of the 16th or 17th centuries may not
unreasonably think himself as competent to guess the riddle asa
scholar ol the ath or 5th. It is manifest that no impassable barrier
separares cases where the MSS. are divided from those where they are
consentient. Division is only a signos the disease. We have already
seen that it is confessedly possible for the same blunder to infest
every MS. A modern editor will probably set aside, as a rule, purely
conjectural emendations ; at any rate, he will hesitate to give them
the reality which is implied by printing them in the text3 not because
he denies the possibility of corruptions, or does not feel the plausi·
bility of many conjectures but only because experience bas taught us
that there is no necessary limit even to the cleverest and most plau-
sible guessing, and because it cannot be proved that in such atext as
that of Horace guessing on a large scale is necessary. One more
remark may be allowed. An editor with the feelings which 1 have
described will yet feel bound to recall, and to some extent to discum,
the more famous conjectures which have become part of the literary
history of his author, and in doing so he will run the risk, at times, of
seeming to treat great names ungraciously. It must be remembered
therefore that to have learnt to distrust a method is not to deny the
genius of those who used it, and wh0, by showing us its results at its
best, have taught us the limits of its capability. The solid value of
Bentley’s edition is diminished very little, if at all, by the fact that very
many olbis conclusions are such as we cannot* now accept with any
confidence or even accept at all. There is hardly a question in
Horatian exegesis that is not raised by him, and raised, if at times in
a'form rather more logical thau befits the criticism of a poet, yet
always with a precision and strength, as well as with a fulness of
knowledge, which at least <and it is an editor's chief function) makes
us understand and measure the difficulty.

2. To the constructive criticism of previous centuries has been
added in the present one the destructive criticism of which tlre chief
examples are to be found in the edition of H. Peerlkamp (Harlem,
1854 ; Amsterdam, 1862) aud in the work of Gruppe, Minos: iiber
die Interpolationen iu den romiscben Dichtern, Leipzig, 1859. This,
like the former, proposes to carry us back beyond the ageos MSS. or
Scholia: unlike the former, it cannot even appeal to indicatione of
disturbance in the MSS. which would explain, if they did not require,
its theories. The antecedent probability of defects in the archetype
wrongly filled up cannot be denied in the face of evidence that such
