that seem to accompany its mention and by its recurrence among the
reminiscences of the poet’s own life in the Epistles. That amere
literary reminiscence‚ an echo of his amatory poems rather than of
his feelingS, is intended seems unlikely in the absence of the name
from all his early poerns. The exception, however, tells rather against
than for the reality of the personages who are not similarly recalled ;
and Buttmann draws attention to the fact that this one unknown
person who seems more than a shadow is the subject only of allusion,
not of a substantive poem.

What has been said will obviously not apply with equal force to
the EpodeS, where, in idea at least, personality is the essenos of the
poem. The introduction of Horaee’s own name, as in Epod. 15, and
the pursuance of his attaclz upon Canidia through three Epodes and
three Satires seem to indicate more real and definite objects. Eut
the use of poetical names for characters who have no existence save
at the moment begins doubtless in the Epodes, as do other features

of the Odes. s

A conrannrwrlnv, or, as Dr. Kennedy prefers to call it, ‘prolative'
infinitive seems properly to have been allowed only to verbs whose
idea was not complete without such a· definition of their scope;
whether the simple verbs that express power, duty, inclination, pur-
pose, effort, beginning, etc, and the negation of any of these (‘ pos-
sum,’ ‘debeo,' ‘volo,’ ‘conon' ‘incipio’ ‘nequeo' ‘nolo ’); or again
the simple verbs which express the allowing another, or intluencing
him, to do or abstain from doing something (‘ sino‚' ‘patior,’ ‘iubeo'
‘doce0,’ ‘cogo’ ‘vet0,' ‘prohibeo' etc). There is a tendency, how-
ever, even in the most classical prose writers to extend the first at
least of these two classes by including verbs which do not properly
require any such complement, and which therefore, if any further
definition of their scope or purpose were needed, would in strictness
have found it rather by means either of some subordinate clause or of
one of those substantival forms of the verb which could indicate‘its
