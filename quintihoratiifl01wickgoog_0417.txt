384 INDEX OF METRES.

θεοῖσιν, ‘Ille rni par esse deo ridetur? The lengthening 01 the short
syllable in 2. 6. 14, ‘Angulus ridet, ubi non Hymetto,' is perhaps
a trace 01 the feeling that, as the first syllable 01 the dactyl, it had the
metrical accent upon it.

The caesura falls commonly, in the first three Books, after the fifth
syllable, ‘Iam satis terris: though it is found, from time to time, after
the sixth, ‘Quem virum aut heroa' ln the Carm. Sec. and the
Fourth Book, Horace returns in this point to the use of Catullus and
the Greek, and employs the second caesura frequently. ln either the
three Sapphic Odes of Book Four together, or in the Carrn. Sec.
alone, there are twice as many instances of itas in the twenty-one
Odes 01 the earlier Books

There is no synaphen, but hyperrnetric syllables are occasionally ⁴
elided at the end of all the first three verses 01 the stanza (2. 2. 18, 2.

1 16. 34, 4. 2. 22, 23, C· S· 47)· By Sappho the Adonis was treated

as if it scanned continuously with the verse before, and this use is
preserved in Horace to some extent, aword being at times divided
between them (r. 2. 19, 1. 25. 11, 2. 16. 7). On the other hand, ure
find a hiatus at times, as in 1. 2. 47 ‘Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum
Ocior aura?

§ 4. Iombt'c metres.

Of these two occurin Horace :—

(1) The common Senarius or lambio Trimeter (for the'name
see Ars Poet. 252)111Ε11011. 17.

(2) Couplets of the Senarius and an lambio Dimeter in Epod.
1-10.

Horace does not observe the law of the Greek Tragic Senarius in
respect of a short syllable before a final cretio, see eg. Epod. 1. 21
and 29.

Three instances occur of an apparent anapaest in the fifth place:
Epod. 2. 35 ‘laqueo' 5. 79 ‘inferius' 11. 23 ‘mulierculam'3 but
Meineke rightly explained them as instances of synizesis or using
e and r' as semivowels, after the analogy of ‘aurea’ in Virg. Aen.
1. 698, and of ‘consilium’ and ‘principium' in Od. 3. 4. 41 and
3. 6. 6. '

§5. These metres account for 97 out of the 104 Odes (including the
Carm. 800), and 11 out of 17 Epodes

Of the remaining 11101103, 0110 01 at the most two or three
specimens exist, which are to be riewed rather, as 1111111110
remarks, as experiments.

5. Α11111011111111,Ο(1. 1. 7 and 28, and Epod. 12.
