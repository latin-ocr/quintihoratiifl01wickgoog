29. soll. He sums up the morai ol the
preceding stanzas, and applies lt to the
special case of Lollius. ‘The pre·
Homeric heroes are dead and lorgotten
and, being lorgotteu, what differente
does it make whether they were heroes
or cowards? We will not allow such a
mistake to occur again now.’ Iu the
words paullum sepultae, etc.. both the
participles really belong equally to both
substantivas. ‘If you hide them (i. e.
do not give them lame through poetry)‚
valour differs little from cowardice so
soon as they are both in the grave?
The appropriation of a participle to
each substantive is only a poetical arti·
fice to obtain point and preciseness in
sound. We gain from it the additional
suggestion of the equivalence of the two
conditione. ‘All colours are alike in
the dark’3 ‘buried in obliviosi, buried
iu the grave, there is little differente in
the conditions‚ even if the things in
question are as far apart as valour and
cowardice.' On Horace's practice oi
dividing between two subjects qualities
which are meant to be attributed to
, both, see on 2.Ι 10. 6, 2. 11. r, a.15.18‚
20, 3. 4. 18, Epod. 5. 37. Bentley,
missing this explanation, finds great
difficulty in the text, complaiuing that

virtue differs little s1·0mbaseuess‚’' but il
you substitute “buried baseness” the
point of'the comparisou is gone! He
ingeniously proposed to remedy it by
reading ‘inertia' ablativa ‘Virtus if
concealed by [the poet’s] remissuess‚ is
as though it were buried.'

special though delicate reference to

in a Roman metaphor, the Stoic paradox
that the wise man is always a king, and
