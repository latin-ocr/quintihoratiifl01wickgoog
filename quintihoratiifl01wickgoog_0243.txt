HORATII CARMINUM

Tibi qualum Cythereae puer alea, tibi telas

Operosaeque Minervae studium aufert, Neobule‚ 5
Liparaei nitor Hebri,

Simul unctos Tiberinis humeros lavit in undis,

Eques ipso melior Bellerophonte, neque pugno

Catus idem per apertum fugientes agitato-

Grege cervos iaculari et celer alto latitantem-
Fruticcto excipere aprum.

pila, nunc celeri volvitur orbe trochus.
Nunc ubi perlusa est oleo labente
iuventus Delessos artus Virgine tingit
aqua! It would seem fronr this that

. they used the oil after exercise and

before bathing. It has been otherwise
taken of the anointing before some
