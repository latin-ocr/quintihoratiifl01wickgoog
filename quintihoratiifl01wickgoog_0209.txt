HORATII CARMINUM

Fatalis incestusque iudex
Et mulier peregrina vertit
In pulverem, ex quo destituit deos
Mercede pacta Laomedon, mihi
Castaeque damnatum Minervae
Cum populo et duce fraudulento.
Iam nec Lacaenae splendet adulterae 25
Famosus hospes nec Priami domus
Periura pugnaces Achivos
Hectoreis opibus refringit,
Nostrlsque ductum seditionibus
Bellum resedit. Protinus et graves
Iras et invisum nepotem,
Troica quem peperit sacerdos

19. fatalis (cp. Adoraprs-Airdrraprs),
‘doum-fraught.’ The two epithets are
meant to have a close connection.

iudex, ‘manet alta mente repostum
Iudicium Paridis,' Virg. Aen. 1. 26.
The epithet ‘incestus’ is fitly applied to
himas ‘iudex.' inasmuch as his judg-
mentwasdeterminedbyVenus’prornise,
τὴν δ’ ᾔνησ’ἥ oi πόρε μσχλοσύνην ἀλε-
γεινήν, Hom. 11. ²4· 30.

20. mulier peregrina. There is a
seornful emphasis in the manner in
which Juno refuses to name Helen or
Paris.

vertit tn pulverem, reduced to dust,
Gr. ἀμαθύνειν, as Hom. Il. 9. 593.

21. ex quo, construet ‘damnatum
ex quo,' etc. The sentence was passed
at the time of Laomedon’s fraud; it
was executed in Priam¹s time; so the
‘dux' of ν. 24 must be Laomedon. For
the story of his cheating Apollo and
Neptune of their bargained wages for
building the walls of Troy see Hom. 11.
23. 442 foll.

aa. merosde paeto, an abl. absol..

“ ‘promised them weges and then failed

them'; or it may be as Fore. takes it,
after the analogy of the ablative with
‘fraudare' eg. ‘ praeda,’ Liv, 2. 42.
mihi damnatum=‘addictum‚’ given
over for punishment, as Virg. Aen. 4.
699 ‘Stygioque caput damnaverat Orco!
Bentley wished to read 'damnatam'
against the MSS, as ‘obsessam Ilion' is
found in Epod. 14. 14, and he is fol·
lowed by Lachmann and Ritter. But
we have ‘ilio superbo’ in Od. 1. 10. 14,

and ‘ilion' is a nom. in Ov. Met. 6. 95.

I5id. ductum, as ‘trahere bellum?
Sall. Jug. 643 ‘prolonged by our quar-
rels,' ‘seditio’ in the sense os orders.

30. protinus, ‘this moment, and
from heuceforth.'

51. nepotem, Romulus is the grand·
son ol Juno as the sou of Mars; his
birth is a fresh grievance besides the
‘graves irae' against his Trojan an-
cessstdi'Juno will not name Rea Silvia;
see on vv. 19, ao. There is probably
additional scorn in the close conjunctim
