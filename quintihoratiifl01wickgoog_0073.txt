ODE X.

‘Hrrrurrs est in Mercurium ab Alcaeo lyrico poeta,’ Porph. Pausaniae, 7. ao,
mentions a hymn to Hermes hy Alcaeus, and that it contained the story of his
theft of the oxen. Among the fragments of his poetry (Fr. 3 Bergk) there is
what seems to be the first line of a Sapphic Ode to Hermes :-

χαΐρε Κυλλάνας ὂ μέδεις, σὲ γάρ μοι.

The Ode is a study, and doubtless an imitation, not a translation, from Greek.
Mercurius, identified with the Greek Hermes, is celebrated as the teacher of
language; of the palaestra 3 of the lyre; ol craft, theft included; as the herald,
πομπαῖοςτ on earth and below it.
Compare Ovid, Fast. 5. 663-692 ‘Clare nepos Atlantis‚' etc.
