HORATH. carminum

Tempestivius in domurn

'Pauli purpureis ales oloribus,
*Comissabere Maximi,

Si torrere iecur quaeris idoneum:
'Namque et nobilis et decens

Et pro sollicitis non tacitus reis
Et centum puer artiurn

Late signa feret militiae tuae,
Et, quandoque potentior

Largi muneribus riserit aemuli,
Albanos prope te lacus

Ponet marmoream sub trabe citrea. 20

9. tempestivius, ‘you will beamore
¹timely guest thera’

iu domum. A rival reading with
good support is ‘in domo’ 3 but her
‘car of swans' implies that ‘comissari’
is used rather in the Greek sense of
κῶμος, amoving band of revellers or
serenaders (Theoc. 3. 1 κωμάσδω ποτὶ τὰν
Ἀμαρυλλίδα), than in its more usual
Latin sense ol a stationary revel. The
reading ‘comissabere’ is quite certain,
but the unusual word makes great havoc
among the copyists. Some of the best
MSS. are at fault. ‘Comls habere‚'
‘comitabere' ‘commutabere‚' etc. F or
the future tense see on Od. 1. 6. 1.

10. Pauli Maximi. Two persons
are suggested, one or other ol ,whom
may possibly be intended. (1) Paulus
Fabius Maximus, consul aa. 11, who
would now be, unless he were made
consul long before the regular aga about
forty years old; (a) his son or nephew,
Ovid's patron, an intimate of Augustus,
who was consul twenty years after-
wards. It is a question whether it is
least improbable that Horace should
callhismiddle-agedsriend‘puer‚’making
the most ol the ten years between them,
or that the younger man should be
spoken ofin such terms when a mere
boy. .
purpureis ales oloribus, ‘on the
wings of lustrous swans‚' ie. in a chariot
drawn by them. od. 3. 28. 15. For
‘purpureis' see on 1. 13. 2 ‘roseam
cervicem,’ Virg. Aen. 1. 590 'lumenque
iuventae Purpureum?

12. laeum 1. 25.15.

idoneum, perhaps another reminis·
cence of 3. 26. 1.

13. deoans3 1. 4. 6.

14. ‘No tongra-ded champion oi
tremblingp1·isoners.’ Cp. a. 1.13 ‘in-
signe maestis praesidium reis.'

15. centum artium, the descriptive
genitive; Madv. t 287, with obs, 3.
n seems to have been almost a prover-
bial expression. ‘Omnium artium puer-
ulos‚’ Cic. Rosc. Am. 41.

17. quandoque, usually =‘aliquando';
but Horace uses it as=‘quandocunque.’
Cr· Od- 4· 2· 34. A· P· aso· ,

potentior seems to some degree to
continue the metaph. of ‘militiae tuae?
‘So soon as he shall laugh triumphant
over the presents of his open-handed
rival? His rival can give richer pren
sents; Paulus figlrts and vanquishes him
with arms which Venus lends him-
beanty, youth, etc. ‘Muneribus’ is the
ablativa of comparison alter ‘potentior'

19. Albanos . ‚lanua where Paulus,
it is implied had a vilia. The title in·
eludes the Lago d’ Albano and the Lago
di Nemi.

ro. ponet marmoream cp. Sat. r.
3. 183 ‘aeneus ut stes? and the promise
inVirg. E. 7. 31 ‘Si proprium hoc fuerit
levi de marmore tota . . stabis' χαλκοῦν

citrea. The reading ‘Cypria ¹ found
ina lew good MSS, seems to be due to
the copyist's reminiscente of Od. 1. 1.
13, where the connection is wholly
different. The ‘cirrus’ is mentioned
by Pliny (N. H. 1316) as much used
in temples on account of the durability
os the wood. What it was is not so cer·
tain; apparently some kind of cypress
or cedar; certainly different from the
cirron, the ‘Medicum maium’ ol Virg. ·

G. 2. 126.
