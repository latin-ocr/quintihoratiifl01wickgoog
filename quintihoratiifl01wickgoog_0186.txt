takes ‘tibi quod negarit’ of life, as
though it meant ‘I may perhaps survive
you! But a more general sentiment is
a better introduction to the next two
stanzas3 and it is the broad equality of
men’s lots that is in point, so that
‘mihi porriget tibi quod negarit’ would
seem naturally to imply the converse
also. that Grosphus will have what
Horace has not.

53. Grosphus has large pasturas in
Sicily. For this form of wealtb see on
1. 31. 5. Cp. Epod. r. 27, Epp. 2. 2. 117.

is to be distinguished hom ‘vaccae’
according to the common opposition of

, ‘greges et armenta‚' ‘floeks and herds‚'

there isan easy zeugma in the use oi
‘mugiunt’ Possibly. however, ‘greges
vacuaeque’=‘ greges vaccarum’ (cp.
Epod. 2. 11 ‘mugientium greges ⁵), the
two being separated in order to give
more emphasis to the numeral and ad·

Afro, Epp. 2. 2. 181 ‘vestes Gaetulo
murice tinctas.’

38. spiritum Camenae, equivalent
as the commentatore say, to the lua
πνεῖν Μούσαις of the epigram on Sappho
(Anal. Brunck. p. 449) save that ⁸ spirare’
and ‘spiritus’ have a special reference,
which we do not know in πνεῖν, to the
‘thoughts that breathe aud words that
bum’ of poetry. Cp. Od. 4. 3. 24
‘Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo, tuum
est’ 4. 6. 29 ‘Spiritum Phoebus mihi,
Phoebus artem Carminis nomenque
dedit poetae.y See also Sat. 1. 4. 42-47,
where the name of poet is limited to the
man, ‘Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divi·
nior atque os Magna sonaturum‚’ and it
is doubted whether comedy can claim

to be poetry‚ ‘quod acer spiritus ac vis
Nee verbis nee rebus inest.'

tenuem has no doubt a close relation
to ‘Graiae’ and describes the polish
and refinemeut of taste which Horace
missed in the earlier Roman literature.
Cp. Α. P. 323, where there is the same
antithesis as that hinted here between
the delicacy of literary taste and the
coarser Roman zie with its love of
wealth‚ ‘Graiis i genium) etc. 1r is
difficult to say how much feeling os the
metaphor remains in either ‘spiritum’
or ⁸ tenuem.³ Il this passage stood alone
we should have no difficulty in iuter-
preting ‘tenuem' of the fineness and
delicacy of the air, but ‘tenuia’ like
the Gr. λεπτόν and corresponding words
in many languages‚ is used widely of
nicety of judgment or taste or expres-
sion. Horace gives it in this sense
another metaphorical connection, Epp.
2. 1. 225 ‘tenui deducta poemato filo.'
The rival interpretation of ‘tenuem
spiritum’ as=‘ particulam aliquam exi-
guam spiritus’ is not so good. Ho-
race’s sarm is ‘small’ but we do not
want to continue the depreciatiou ol his
lot, but to enioree the doctrine ol the
lair balaneing ol fortune by coutrasting
his modest external means with the
richness of his mental gifts.

Camenae, used without scruple ol the
Greek Μοῦσαι. Cp. ‘Pindarieae Ca·
menae,' Od. 4. 9. 8.

39. non mendax dedit, Carm. S. 25
‘veraces oecinisse Parcae! ‘Fate as·
signed to me that lot in days gone by,
and she has kept her word.³

malignum spernere volgus, either
the same as Od. 3. 2, 23 “ [Virtus] Coe·
'rusque vulgares et udam Spernit humum
fugiente penna’; ‘malignum’ being:
‘profanum' in 3. 1. 1, or more likely re·
lerring to the envy which his fortune
and his rising fame brought with them,
see on Od. a. ao. 4-7.
