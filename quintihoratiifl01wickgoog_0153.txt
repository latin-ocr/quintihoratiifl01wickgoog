HORATII CARMINUM

Cedes et exstructis in altum
Divitiis potietur heres.
Divesne prisco natus ab Inacho
Nil interest, an pauper et infima
De gente sub divo moreris,
Victima nil miserantis Orci.
Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium
Versatur urna serius ocius
Sors exitura et nos in aeternum
Exsilium impositura cumbae.

ODE IV.

‘No need to blush, Xanthias, though you love a slave girl. Achilles had his

Briseis, and Ajax his Tecmessa; even Agamemnon, the conqueror of Troy, could ,

not withstand Cassandra. Who knows but Phyllis too is some born princess:
one so constant and so indifferent to money can spring srom no vulgar stock. Nay,
don't suspect my praises, Ι am close on forty.’

We can hardly be wrong in supposing that, with the exception os her pretty
face and figure, the praises of Phyllis are meant to be interpreted ironically. The

mock heroic tone of the list of precedente (cp. Od.1.16,lntrod.,andEpod. 3), ,

the ‘regium certe,' and the contempt implied sor her real birth, ‘scelesta plebe,’ ·
might be merely playful; but considering the topics of praise, ‘sic fidelem, sic
lucro aversam,’ there is hardly feeling enough in their expression, standing as they
do between the levity of'stanzas 4 aud 6, to redeem the playfulness from the sting
of irony.
