¹OjDE XI.

O Marcum and my lyre, teaeh me some strain that will win 'the ohdurate ear of
Lyde. She is like a young unbroken colt; but music has made tigers and forest
trees and rivers stay to listen. It has tamed Cerberussand beguiled the painof
Ixion and Tityus and the Danaids with their leaking pitchers. Let Lyde hear
their tale-how they slew their husbands, all save one-their punishment, and
Hypermnestra¹s undyiug glory.

, Lyde is warneri not ‘placito pugnare amori’ by the story of theDanaids and

their punishment, and the noble exception of Hypermnestra. The application of
the story is not· very close. The form of the Ode seems robe a nearer imitation
than usual of the construction of an Ode of Pindar; the commencement by an
invocation of Mercury and the lyre ; the occidental way inwhich, through the
recountal of the feats of music, the Danaids are introduced3 the myth told at
length, but left to be applied by the reader’s wit. Compare 3. 3 and 3, ²7·

For the story of the Danaids read Aesch. Pr. V, 853-869 and Ov. Her. 14
‘Hypermnestra‘Lynceol which contains frequent reminiscences and expressions ol
passages in this Ode. Compare vv. 3, 4 ‘Clausa domo-‘teneor gravibusque coer·
cita vinclis: Est mihi supplicii ,causa fuisse piam,’ etc. with vv. 45, 46 of the Ode,
vv. 35, 36 with 41 solt, vv. 73, 74 ⁶ Surge age, Belide, ‘ de tot modo fratribus unus;
Nox tibi, ni properas, ista-perennis erit,' with vv. 37, 58, and vv. 127-130 with
v. 51, see note. ·

Ritter suggests that the story would be especially familiar to the Roman public
at the time when Horace was writing these odes, from the fact that a group oi the
Danaids formed a chief feature in the portico ol the temple of Apollo on the Pala-
tine, which Augustus dedicatedin uo. 28 (see Od. 1. 31). Prop. 3. 23. 4, Ov. A. A.
