HORATII CARMINUM

Tuque testudo resonare septem
Callida nervia,
Nec loquax olim neque grata, nunc et 5
Divitum mensis et amica templis,
Dic modos Lyde quibus obstinatas
Applicet aurea, Ι
Quae velut latis equa trima campis
Ludit exsultim metuitque tangi,
Nuptiarum expers et adhuc protervo
Cruda marite.
Tu potes tigres comitesque silvas
Ducere et rivos celeres morari3
Cessit immanis tibi blandienti

Ianitor aulae,
Cerberus, quamvis furiale centum
Muniant angues caput eius atque
