HORATII CARMINUM

Rava decurrens lupa Lanuvin0,
Fetaque volpes,

Rumpat et serpens iter institutum,

Si per obliquum similis sagittae

Terruit mannos: ego cui timebo
Providus auspex,

Antequam stantes repetat paludes

Imbrium divina avis imminentum,

Oscinem corvum prece suscitabo
Solis ab ortu.

Sis licet felix, ubicunque mavis

Et memor nostri, Galatea, vivas

decurrens Lanuvino. Lanuvium,
now Civita Larigna, was 011 0 hill about
a mileto the right of the Via Appia (cp.
Cic. pro Mil. c. 10), by which Galatea is
starting, Iike Horace in Sat. 0110111111·
disium and the passage 10 Greece.

5. rnrnpat et. There is no incon·
sistency‚ as Bentley objects, between the
wishes 01 the first and second stanzas.
They are really alternatives, though put,
astera common fashion‚ conjunctively,
like the Homeris εἴθ’ ὅφελεε ἄγονός τ’
ἔμεναι 1111111110 τ’ ἀπολέσθαιτ see on 3.
11. 49. ‘Let evil omens attend the set-
ting forth, or stop the journey 01 the
wicked.' Both things may happen 10
1110111, though not to the same people 011
the same occasion. ε1,’110 continues,
‘if with my knowledge of auguryI 0111
anxious for a friend, will at least do
my best to procure good omens for her.
Go, Galatea, where you like best, and
good omens go with you? Keller and
M1·.Munr0 follow Bentley in adopting
the reading ‘rumpit,' which is found
in a few MSS. 01 value, 01111 111 the best
MSS (1101111 the interpretation) 01 Αο1.
01111 Porph. This alteration gives a
different 00100110 1110 whole passage.
All three stanzas will then, though under
varied forins, be really direct statements
of the omens which stop, 01 ought 10
stop, persons 110111 setting out 011 0
journey. ‘Only those who think 110-
thing 01 religion would 11011 in spite
01 the hooting of an owl (1110 formis

road: 1 shall pray, when Ι am anxious
101 0 iriend's safety, 101 the omen of a
croaking crow in the east, instead of
11101 01 the raven fiying away 10 the
pools.’ The transition from this to
stanna 4 is very awkward, unless, with
Bentley and Munro‚ we complete the
sense by adopting, inv. 15, the conjec-
ture of Lambinus, ‘vetat’; so that will
mean, ί101001000011010100, there are
11011001 these bad omens? The ‘que’
in v. 15 is awkward in that case, and
the direct enunreration 01 the omens
must have owed its point, if 11 had any,
10 circumstanceswhich we do not know.

7. oui timebo, ‘for one 101 whom’;
the dative has to do double duty. ‘Cui'
is the reading of the Bland. Vel. and
the other best MSS: it was corrupted
to ‘cun’ and then to ‘quid'

8. providus auspex. He will not
only wait ior the omens and‘jndge thern
when they come, but will look lorward
to them, and try to procure good ones.

ra ‘aquae augur annosa cornix‚’ of the
sarne bird. Both ‘stantes paludes’ and
‘vaga ' seem to referto the same sign of
bad weather as that mentioned by Virg.
G. 1. ι188 ‘Tum 00111111 plena pluviam
vocat improba voce Et sola in sicca
secum spatiatur arena' Horace will pray
that the ornen 01 good weather may
anticipare and prevent the omen 01 bad.

its voice‚' according to the division 01
birds of omen given in Virg. Aen. 3. 361
