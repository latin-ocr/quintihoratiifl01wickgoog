'HORATII EPODON

EPODE Vl.

‘You are like a watchdog who flies at a guest but is afraid of a wolf. Turn
your imputent attack on me: I have ‘teeth; f follow my quarry to the death.
l'oa bark lond enough, but will turn aside for a piece of ineat. Beware, Iam
a bull with sharp horne, and ready to attack those who deserve it, as ready as
Archilochus or Hipponax. 1 will not take an insult’

Iu assailing the wrong use of the poetry of invective, Horace indicates its right
use. The misuser of iambic verse attacks the innocent and defenceless‚ ancl is
ready to be bought off. What can we wish better than that he should provoke
the true wielder of Archilochus' weapon and be the object instead of the writer of
an Epouet

The person intended is not known. Acron calls him ‘Cassium maledicum
poetam? The Comm. Cruq. further identifies him with Cassius Severus, an orator
of name (Quint. 10. 1. 177), but a libellous writer (Tac. Ann. 1. 72). He is known
to have died nn. 32, and it is perhaps hardly probable that he can have written
lampoons such as to attract Horace's anger (as this would obliga us to suppose)
,at the least sixty-three years before. Nor is there any hint elsewhere of his having
,been a poet. Ritter suggests Furius Bibaculus, who is elsewhere ridiculed by
Horace (see on Sat. r. ro. 37, 2. 5. 41), and who is classed with Catullus by Quin-
tilian (10. 1. 96) as a-writer os bitter ‘iambi' ‘ [iambi] cuius acerbitas in Catullo,
Bibaculo, non in Horatio reperietur,’ and who is named by Tac. Anu. 4. 34 as a
lampooner of the Caesarian family.
