ODE l.

‘Heme the reaching os the Muses, ye that are fit to receive it. All human
greatness is bounded. Kings are above us, but Jove is above kings; men may
differ in wealth aud rank, but Death makes no distinction. To oue who has the
sword of Damocles above his head no feasts will laste sweet, no music bring sleep;
yet sleep may be had in peasants' cois or on a shady river bank. Moderate your
desires. It is not the desire for what is enough for life that puts the trader's
happiness at the mercy of a stormy sea, or the sarmer’s at the mercy of the westher.
The rich proprietor‚ weary of the sameness of the dry land, builds houses out into
the sea3 but sear and conscience and care are not to be escaped; marbles and
purple and costly wines can't take awaya paug. Don't ask me, then, to change
my happy Sabine valley for a palace that will only bring on me envy, and wealth
that only increases trouble.’

The exordium suits the beginning oia Book, and also indicates that the Ode or
Odes which follow have some special dignity. The sequence of six Odes in the
same melre, and dealing with the same general subject, is by itself sufficiently
different from the poet¹s usual practice to attract remark. Diomedes‚in his account
oi Horace's metros, treats thern as one continuone poem, numbering Ode 7 as 2;
and both MSS. and Scholiasts are inclined to prees, beyond the bounds of proba·
bility‚ the connection between one Ode and another (see Introd. to Ode 3, and note
on4. 1). The cuiry, however, os general purpose is obvious. The ends social,
moral, religious¹ political which a good government would set before itself in
Rome are reviewed‚ and it is more than once promised that Caesar's re'gime is to

compass them. The Odes fall by their subject, as well as by resemblances of 1

detail, into the same period as Odes 15, 16,18 of Book ii, and Ode 24 of this
Book.

The chief internal evidences of date are the references in Ode 6 to the still recent
Bellum Actiacum (vv. 13-16: cp. 4. 37, 38) and to Augustus' exercise of the censo·
1 rian power (nc. 28: see Introd, to Od. 2. 15). The name of ‘Augustus’ in 3. 11,
if it is held to fix that Ode after januam, nc. 27, when that title was conferred by
the senate on Octavianus, will still leave it within the general period assigned to the
others.
