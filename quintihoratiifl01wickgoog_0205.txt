HORATII CARMINUM

Nec parcit imbellis iuventae
Poplitibus timidoque tergo
Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae
Intaminatis fulget honoribus,
Nec sumit aut ponit secures
Arbitrio popularis aurae.
Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Caelum negata tentat iter via,
Coetusque volgares et udam
Spernit humum fugiente penna. -
Est et fideli tuta silentio
Merces: vetab0, qui Cereris sacrum

he cannot be disgraced, he cannot be
defeated. And the honours (high
offices) which he gains haye no stain
on them as is the case with those
gained in the Comitia? These two
paradoxes are explained by a third,
‘the consulship which he filis is neither
taken up nor resigned in accordance
with the shifting wind of popular fa·
your? In the same strain Horace tells
Lollius that his soni is ‘Consul non
unius anni Sed quoties bonus atque fidus
Iudex honesto praetulit utili,' 4. 9. 39.
He has clothed in Roman ianguage the
Stoic paradox that the wise man is al-
ways a king, cp. Epp. 1. 1. 107, Sat. 1. 3.
136, and see on Od. z. a. 9. Compare
the exposition os it in Cicero, Acad.
Quaest. 4. 44, and the anecdote which
he tells, 'Albinum quitum praetor esset,
cum Carneades et Stoicus Diogenes ad
, Senatum in Capitolio starent, iocantem
Carneadi dixisse: Ego tibi praetor esse
non videor quia sapiens non sum . . turn
ille, Huic Stoico non videris!

’ 17. repulsae, the technical word for
losing an electior.

18. intaminatis, a few MSS. read
‘incontaminatis’ which Bentley is in-
clined to support. ‘Intaminatns¹ is an
ἅπαξ λεγ., but formed naturally from the
g obsolete ‘tamino' (Fest. s. w), found in
‘contamina' ‘attamino’

In Virgil's ‘gaudens popularibus auris·
Aen. 6. 817, the idea is of a favouring
wind, here it is of the changeableness
of the wind. Compare the uses of
πνεῦμα and πνοή. .,

21. Compare the epigram of Si-
monides on those that fell with Leoni·
das (§ 98. ed. Bergk) Οὐδὲ τεθνᾶσι θα-
νόντες, ἐπεί σφ’ ἀρετὴ καθύπερθε Κυδαθ-

Cp. 3. 30. 6 ‘Non omnis moriar,’ 4. 8.

mori: Caelo Musa beat,' with the
verses before and after.

aa. negata, ‘pennis non homini

Virtus makes one. Ouid, probably irni-

Ennius.

23. udam opp. to ‘liquidum aethera,'
2. ao. a, etc.

25. The sslf-restraint that can keep
a secret is praised as one oi theold
Roman virtues. Compare 1. 18. 16
‘arcani Fides prodiga‚' Sat. 1. 4. 84
‘commissa tacere Qui nequit, hic niger
et,’ etc. and Volteius over Philippus¹
wine, ‘dicenda tacenda locutus,' Epp.
