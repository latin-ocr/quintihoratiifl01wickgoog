LIB. III. OD. 24.

Si figit adamantinos
Summis verticibus dira Necessitas
Clavos non animum metu,
Non mortis laqueis expedies caput.
Campestres melius Scythae,
Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos 10
Vivunt et rigidi Getae,
immetata quibus iugera liberas

tantum sea etiam inuria occupantem? ιοιικεφαλῆςδ’ἅπτεταιάκροτάτηςίςροίιοη

The full expression will then be, ‘Every of old age)‚and a fragment (3)οί Rhianus

5-8. The image in this place is not
clear. We may perhaps compare 2. 18.
29. In both cases Horace is pointing
the irony of fate, which allows a man
to begin to build what he may not live
to finish. In both cases ‘Orcus' or
‘Necessitas' are represented under
images borrowed from the employnnent
of the rich man himself. In a. 18 he is
busy planning his palare. Death has his
measuring rod too, andis planning a
home for him which he shall yet more
surely tenant. Here he is laying the
foundations of his palace deep in the
sea; but who knows that Fate may not
snatch his hammer from him and ‘drive
the last nails into the gahle-top’ herself?
He will have the toll, but he will not
finish the work himself. Death will
stop him. We may rememher that
‘nails for building,' ‘clavi trabales,' are
already a recognised implement of ‘Ne-
cessitas’ ι. 55. 18; so that Horace
would say, ‘You are buildiug. Fate is
a builder as well as you, and she may
finish your house for you.² The plural

Fate finishing his work for him, bnt it

parallel to the images of r. 35. 16-20.
See note there.

7, 8. The thought of death and the
doom of death are both represented as
a halter round the neck, from which
there is no release, if (we should rather
put it in prose—since there is the possi·
biliry thar) an irreversible Fate has
already fixed the limit of our pians.
