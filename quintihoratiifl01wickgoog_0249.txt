HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XVI.

‘Gonu is all potuerim, and powerful sor haim. Mythology and history prove it.
And with the growth of wealth care grows and the thirst ior greater wealth.
Itake example by you, Maecenas, and shun eminence. The more we deny our·
selves the more the gods give us. Iam prouder aud happier iu my poor little
farm, its clear stream, its wood. and unfailing crops, thau the man who owns all
Africa. Ihare no superfluous luxuries, but Ι never feel the pains oi penury.
Reduced desires give a larger revenue than the widest “latifundia'’ Who seek
much want much. Happy the man who has, though little, yet enough!

The Ode ison Horace's common theme, the praise of contentmeut and the
‘aurea mediocritas’ of fortune.
