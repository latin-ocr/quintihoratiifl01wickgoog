HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XI.

‘Mr wine is ready, and we are all astir preparing the feast; soritis the Ides os
April, Maecenas’ birthday. Corne, thengrhyllis, and keep it with rne; never mind
Telephus. What are such ambitious loves to you? Come, thou last of my flames
(it shall he so, 1 swear), come, and let us sing together?

Ἴ Compare 3. 28, where he invites Lyde to spend· the Neptunalia with him. The
point 01 this Ode seems to lie, not in the invitation to Phyllis, which is only an
incident of the holiday-keeping, but in the occasion, Maecenas' birthday.

Whether the Ode was written at the time of the leading Odes os the Book is
perhaps more than we can say; but 11 characterizes fitly the relations os the poet,
and his early patron at that time.

See lntrod. to the Book, pp. 257, ²59·
