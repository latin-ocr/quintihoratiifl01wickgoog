HORATH CARMINUM

Iactat ultorem, vagus et sinistra
Labitur ripa Iove non probante u-

xorius amnis

Audiet cives acuisse ferrum,
Quo graves Persae melius perirent,
Audiet pugnas vitio parentum

Rara iuventus

Quem vocet divum populus ruentis

Imperi rebus? prece qua fatigent

Virgines sanetae minus audientem
Carmina Vestam?

Cui dabit partes scelus expiandi

the story of her being thrown into the
Tiber. Claudian calls her ‘Tiberini
uxor) Ovid represents her as finding
a refuge and a husband in the Anio.

salia, esp. v. 10 foll. ‘Cumque superba
foret Babylon spolianda tropaeis Au·
soniis, umbraque erraret Crassus inulta,
Bella geri placuit nullos habitura tri
umphos;' see also Epod. 7. 5-10. ι

and fourth lines of a Sapphic staina, cp.
r. 25. 11 ‘sub inter-lunia vento;’ 2. 16.
7 ‘neque purpura ve-nale neque auro?

21. cives. The purpose for which
the sword is sharpened is indicated
partly by the contrasted⁴better'purpose,
partly by the emphasis on ‘cives' ; not as
soldiers, nor as Romans against fo-
reigners‚ but as citizens, in pursuance
of an intestine, civil quarrel; see on Od.
1. 3²· 5, and 1. 55. 54. Compare the
use of ‘soror' in Virg. Aen. 12. 871.

Persae. From the decline of the
Syro-Macedonian kingdom, ao. a 50 foll.
to the restoration of a Persian dynasty
in the person of Artaxerxes, the founder
of the Sassanidae, ao. 226, the ruling
race of western Asia was the Parthia
tribe originally settled to the east of
bledla, and immediately south of the
Caspian. Their kings, the Arsacidae,
tired their capital at Seleucia ou the
Tigris, where they adopted the pomp
and title ol theold Persian monarchs,

durmale βασιλέων, Βασιλεὺς μέγας. Ho-
race is the only Augustan writer who
calls them ‘Persae’ (and therefore, fol·
lowing the Greek usage, also ‘Medi';
see below, v. 51), an instance pro-
bably of the predominant influeuce of
Greek associations upon his style. Cp.
the still more definite identification of
the two dynasties,0d. a. a. 17‘Redditum
Cyri solio Phraaten.’

24· rara, ‘our youth thinned by their
parents' crimes! There will be lew to
hear the story, for civil war has killed
those who should have bred up sous for
the stater cp. C. S. 17-20.

25. ruentis imperi rebus. The
dative=‘ut rebus succurrat! ‘rebus,’
‘the fortunas? It is a variety ol the
more usual ‘ruentibus rebus,' as Virg.
uses ‘res fractae‚' Tac. ‘res labantes.⁵

26. impari, ‘ the empire ’ = the whole
system of Roman rufe-the State in its
aspect of power and majesty, 1. 37. 8.
Sometimes it contains more definitely
the idea of the dominion of Rome over
foreign peoples, 5. 5. 4, ‘adiectis Brit·
annis Imperio' ; cp. the verb in 3. 6. 5
‘Dis te minorem quod geris imperas
[Romarre].' 4. 15. 14 ‘ fama . . et imperi
Porrecta maiestas ad ortus solis et Hes·
perium cubile' seems to combine both
shades oi meaning.

27. minus audientem, 'turning a
deal ear to their litanies’ Vesta is re·
presented as offended at the murder ol
the Pontifex Maximus, whose office was
specially connected with her service and
