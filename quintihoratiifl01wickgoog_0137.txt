HORATII CARMINUM

O D E XXXVI.

‘Turnus to the gods that have brought Numida saie home again, to the delight
of many friends, and of' noue more than his old schoolsellow Lamia. The day
must have a white stone to mark it. We will revel, we will danae: Bassus shall
rival Darnalis in his draughts os wine today. Every eye will be ou Damalis; but
Darnalis will have no embraces for any one but Numida·

Nothing is known of Numida. Acr. and Por-ph. call him ‘Pomponius Numida,'
the Comm. Cruq. ⁶ Plotius? The latter is more likely to be right, as Numida is
a known cognomen of the Plautia-or Plotia gens: Itis usually supposed that
he was returning from the Cantabriau war, irum which Augustus returned iu
rac. 25 (Οὰ. 3. 14). Numida may of course conceivably have returned earlier.

For Lamia, see on Od. 1. 26.

For the subject of the Ode cp. 2. 7 ou the return oi Pompeius.
