„ LIB. I. OD. 35.

Serves iturum Caesarem in ultimos
Orbis Britannos et iuvenum recens
Examen Eois timendum
Partibus Oceanoque rubra.
Eheu cicatricum et sceleris pudet Ἴ
Fratrumque. Quid nos dura refugimus
Aetas? quid intactum nefasti
Liquimus? unde manum iuventus
Metu deorum continuit? quibus ’

²9· ultimosr, ‘remotis . . Britannia,⁹
Od. 4. 14. 47. Cp. Virg. E. r. 67 ‘pe-
nitus toto divisos ''orbe Britannos '; 'for
the genitive ‘orbis' cp. ‘Extremi homi·
num Morini‚' Virg. Aen. 8. 727.

30. recens examen, Aesch. Pers.
126 uris γὰρ ἶππηλάταε καὶ redocri-
βὴε λεὼς optivus ὡς ἐκλέλοιπεν μελισ·
σᾶν. Horace ¹¹uses the metaphor of
slarfires clusteriug round the fire, Epod.
r. 5.

32. Oceano rubro, the Indian
Ocean with its two arms, the Persian
Gulf and the Red Sea. The intended
expedition to Arabia did not actually
take place till ue. 24, see Introd. to
Od. 1. 29. =

33. cicatricum et sceleris. The
expression is os the nature of what
grammarians call hendiadys. In prose
the ideas would be grouped more logi·
cally. The real object of the feeling ol
‘shame' is one, viz. the ‘ guilt’ of civil
war; the ‘scars ' are only its memorials⁵
the ‘brotherhood’ of the combatants
its aggravation. We are not ashamed
of them in the same sense that we are
ashamed of the guiltt but the feeling
of guilt comes to us through divers
approaches. The poet, whose purpose
it is to wake feeling, tries them in suc·
cessron.

34. fratrumque, Virg. G. a. 510
‘gaudent perfusi sanguine fratrum’
The absence of any definite qualification
of ‘fratrum' such as ‘a fratribus occi·
sorum' is due partly to the fact just
noticed that the word is not intended to
convey the full feeling3 it is only one
approach among several ;-the thought

of brothers is a shameful thought to
Romans, be use they would think also
how brothe s had been treated, as the
thought of scars was shameful, because

“ they could not but remember the quarrel

in which they had been corne by-partly
to the fact that ‘fratrum’ as a correlar
tive term leads our thoughts to its cor-
relative ; of ‘ brothers’ conduct,' means of
their conduct as brothers, and so to-
wards their brethren. Cp. the pregnant
use of ‘cives' in Od. 1. a. rr. Any
more definite expression os the horror
os fratricidal war is purposely avoided
and sunk in the general question ‘quid
nos refugimus’? With the string of
questgons that follow. cp. Od. 2. Ι.
296· ’

rently ofmcr. and Porph. The Beme MS.
has ‘defingas' which Bentley adopted,
altering at the same time ‘retusum’ the
unanimous reading of the old MSS„ to
‘recoctum’ ‘melt and forge anew.'
The verb ‘diffingere’ is found iu no
other author. and in Horace only here
and in Od. 5. 29. 47 ‘neque Diffinget
infectumque reddet! The Scholiasts in-
terpret it here ‘ refabricare‚’ ‘reformare’
there ‘immutare’ It seems to mean
‘to make differently,’ i. e. <in this case)
‘to a different purpose' The swords
have been blunted in civil war, they are
to be beaten straight and sharp again
for a foreign enemy* For the image cp.
Virg. Aen. 7. 636 ‘recoquunt patrios
fornacibus enses?

40. Massagetas, a tribe living to
the east of the Caspias.
