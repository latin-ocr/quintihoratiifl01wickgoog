value, and adopted byRitter 3 ‘procedit’

proposed, inignorance of that fact, by
Heinsius, and supported by Bentley.
Tu whom does the pronoun refer? Only
two answers worthy of consideration
have been given. (ι) To Antonius. Iu
favour os this is the fact that ‘te ’ at the
beginning of the next stanza, undoubt-
edly belongs to him, and it is unlike
Horace’s finished workmanship to put
the same pronoun in an emphatic place
in two consecutive stamas, when the
subjecte to which it refers are wholly
different. Against 'it must be count'ed

Antonius would ride iu Augustus’ cha·

he would take part in the processior as
praetor <this would oblige us to post-

Bentley seems really to dispose in ad-

ought equally to object to Virgil's ‘ Evoe
Bacche fremens solum te virgine dig·
num vociferans: Aen. 7. 389, where
‘Evoe Bacche' isat once the actual cry
of Amata and the vocative case which
explains the ‘te dignum’ (not ‘tu
dignus es'), in which the poet, not
Amata, is the direct speaker. For ‘io
Triumphe’ as the cry raised as the pro-
cession passed along (it was an old cry,
