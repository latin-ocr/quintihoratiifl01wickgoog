HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XV.

Nessus becalms Paris, as he flies with Helen, to foretel to him his own fate and
the destruction os Troy.

‘ Hac ode Bacchylidem imitatur; narn ut ille Cassandram facit vaticinari futura
belli Troiani ita hic Proteum’ Porph. (The last word is a slip arising from a
reminiscence of the proplrecies ol Proteus in Hom. Od. 4.) The same statement
is repeated by‘a Scholiast on Stat. Theb. 7. 330. It, however, the fine verses
which Clement of Alexandria quotes, without giving the name ol their author
(Strorn. 5. 751 ὁ λυρικός φησι), belonged, as is commonly believed, to this poem,
Horace's imitation cannot have extended beyond the mere framerrork.

The lines os Bacchylides arc:—

ὣΤρῶεε Ἀρηΐφιλοι, Zeis ὑψιμέδων, ts ἅπαντα δέρκεται

οὐκ cirros drarois μεγάλων ἀχέων· ἀλλ’ ἐν μέσῳ κεῖται κιχεΐν
πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποισι Δίκαν ὁσίαν, ἁγνάν,

Εὐνομίαν ἀκόλουθον καὶ πινοτᾶε Θέμιδοα·

ὀλβίων παῖδές νιν εὖρόντεο σύνοικον.

Fr. 29 (Bergk).

The imagery ol Horace's Ode is really Homer's rather than that oi the Greek
lyrists, cp. Od. 1. 6. ’

Α Scholiast calls the Ode an allegory of Antony and Cleopatra, and that ex·
planation of it is adopted by several editors,Landinus, Baxter‚ and Sanadon. Ritter
draus the parallel out in detail. Paris, hidden by Venus in Helen’s chamber, is
¹Antony taking refuge in Cleopatra’s ship at Actium, etc. The whole theory is
very improbable. Mitsch. remarks that the first suggestion of it is probably due
to the position oi the Ode. The key which had unlocked the last uas applied to
this. Compare the relation os the next two Odes to one another.

The Ode is imitated by Statius, 'Achill 1. 20 loll.
