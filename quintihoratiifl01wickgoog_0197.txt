HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XX. ›

‘ Horace will stay no longer on earth3 he will mount into the clear air of heaven
and laugh at his detractore. He whom the envious world despiseS, hut whom
Maecenas loves, will not die the common death of men. Already he feels himself
changing to a swan. All the world shall see him and hear his music: funeral rites
have no meaning for him!

Ἴ The Ode may be described as an amplification of Ennius' epitaph on himself :

‘Nemo me lacrymis decoret, neque funera fletu
Faxit. Curi volito vivus per ora virum?

Compare Virgil's imitation of the same (G. 3. 8):

‘Tentanda via est qua me quoque possim
Tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora?

The Ode doubtless owes its place at the end of a Book to its general reference to
Horace and his lyric fame; but it does not look as if tt had been written for such
a purpose, as Od. 3. 50, Epp. 1. ao. Its feeling seems really tolie in vv. 4-8.
