2 INTRODUCTION TO THE

chary of separating without clear cause any single Ode from the
epoch common to the others'

ξ 2. The second lr'mr'l, the latest date at which the Three Books as a
whole can have been published, is fixed mainly by the reference in
Od. 1. 12, 45-48. Marcellus died in the autumn of nu. 23. It isin·
conceivable that these lines should be (as Ritter suggests) a complimen-
tary allusion to one already dead 3 an assurance to Augustus that at
least the farne of his son-in-law survired: all that the author of the
dirge on Quintilius could offer to match Virgil’s ‘Tu Marcellus eris!
And it is almost equally impossible that, written before his early
death, they should have been published (as from other considerations
it would be necessary to conclude) within a year or two of that great
disappointment of the hopes of Rome and of the Emperor.

An argument, second only in weight to this, is founded upon the
Odes (a. 10 and 3. 19) which haue reference to Licinius Murena, the

brother of Terentia, Maecenas' wife (see also on Orl. a. a. 5). Murena ’

was executed for participation with Fannius Caepio in a conspiracy
against Augustus in nc. aa. The presumption seems very strong
that even if Horace's feelings would hare allowed him to publish these
poemS, and especially Od. 2. 10, after his friend’s catastrophe, hc
would have been deterred by the knowledge that the reminiscences
must be displeasing to Maecenas as well as to Augustus. Franke
recalls the story of Virgil's striking out the praises of Gallus from
the end of Georg. iv on somewhat similar grounds,

The arguments sor postponing the publication of the Odes to a
later date are not such as can really be set against these eon·
siderations They turn mainly on Od. 1. 3, which is taken to refer
to the voyage of Virgil to Athens in the last year of his life, nc. 19:
and on the supposed allusions (the strongest case is Od. a. 9) to the
expedition of Tiberius into Armenia, and the restoration of the
standards by the Parthians in ne. 20. Some remarks on these points
will be found in the Introductions to Od. r. 3 and 2. 9. There re-
mains the possibility that these (and if these, then other) Odes may
have been inserted after the first publication. It will be seen that this

is not likely to have been the case with r. 33 and the theory of any κ

such insertions is perhaps hardly compatible with that pause in lyric
composition between the publication of Books i-iii and the corn·
mencement of Book iv, which is implied in Suetonius' statement, and
ln Horace’s own words Od. 4. r. 1, Epp. 1. 1. 1-10.
