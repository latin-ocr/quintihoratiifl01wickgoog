HORATII CARMINUM

Quis non te potius, Bacche pater, teque, decens Venus?
At, ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi,

Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero
Debellata‚ monet Sithoniis non levis Euius

Cum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum

Discemunt avidi. Non ego te, candide Bassareu,
Invitum quatiam, nec variis obsita frondibus

Sub divum rapiam. Saeva tene cum Berecyntio

7. at, so of recent Editors, Keller,
Orelli, Ritter, and Dillf. Cruquius
reads ‘at’ without mentioning any v. l.‚
which is perhaps evidence that he found
it in his Blandinian MSS. Β, and all
tenth century MSS. (except τ, which has
‘aut') have ‘aa’ and Bentley follows
them. But the passages which he
quotes, Epp. 1. 1. 13, 1. 19. 26, a. 1. 208,
do not require an adversative as strongly
as this transition from the use to the
abuse of wine.

modici, ‘that loves moderation,’
‘verecundum Bacchum,' Od. 1. 27. 3.
It would properly be the epithet of the
draught‚ ds δ’ ἂν ὑπερβάλλῃ πόσιος με’-
τρον, Theogn. 47, or of the proportione
of the mixture, see on od. 1. νο. 1.

transiliat, see on 1. 3. 24, ‘lightly

ad culpam causas dedit: ille furentes
Centauros leto domuit‚' etc.

super mero. Ritter takes ‘supen’ of
place, over the spilt wine; Orelli, of
respect=‘de‚' as ‘civiles super urbe
curas' Od. 5.18. 17. In the legend, how·
ever, wine is not the ground of the quar-
rel. Dfflr. thinks that Virgil’s ‘nocte
super media* Aen. 9. 61, will justify us
in taking it of time, ‘after’

9. debellata, see on Od. 1. 5. 13.

Sithoniis, properly the inhabitants
of the middle finger of the three which
run out into the Aegean frorn Chalci·

in their greedy haste they divide right
and wrong by the slender line of their
own appetita' i.e. when the only dis-
tinction they place between right and
wrong is that they desire the thing or
not.

young,’ of the bright beauty of divine
youth3 Epod. 3. 9 ‘candidum ducem‚'

Bassareu, a name of Dionysus from

12. quatiam, properly applied to
the thyrsus and perhaps to the solemn
