Aut ln reducta valle mugientium Ι
Prospectat errantes greges

Inutilesque falce ramos amputans
Feliciores inserit,

Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris,
Aut tondet infirmas oves 3

Vel curn decorum mitibus pomis caput
Auctumnus agris extulit,

Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pira,
Certantem et uvam purpurae,

Qua muneretur te, Priape, et te, pater ι
Silvane, tutor finium!

Libet iacere modo sub antiqua ilice,
Modo in tenaci gramine.
