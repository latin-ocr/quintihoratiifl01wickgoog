HORATII EPODON

Non usitatis, Vare, potionibus
Ο multa fleturum caput,

Ad me recurres nec vocata mens tua
Marsis redibit vocibus:

Maius parabo maius infundam tibi
Fastidienti poculum,

Priusque caelum sidet inferius mari,
Tellure porrecta super,

Quam non amore sic meo flagres uti
Bitumen atris ignibus,-

Sub haec puer iam non ut ante mollibus
Lenire verbis impias,

Sed dubius unde rumperet silentium
Misit Thyesteas preces:

Venena magnum fas nefasque non valent

η Convertere humanam vicem3

75. neo vocata. ‚vocibus ‘nor shall
it be at the summons of Marsian spells
that thy beart shall come back to me‚’
‘Marsis vocibus' corresponding to ‘usi-
tatis potionibus ' in the last clause, both
being answered by‘ Maius parabo, maius

¹ infundam’ etc. This interpretation

trltttttt‘tlltllt{ttttldllt
shall thy heart go back again (i. e. from
mel, though summoned by Marsian
. spells.' The Marsi were famous in
sorcery; Epod. 17. 29, Virg. Aen. 7.
75ofoll.

77. maius parabo, sc. ‘quiddam’
Only the second ‘maius' goes with
‘poculum'

infundam, ‘I will miru'

79. inferius, the last two syllables
coalescet see on Epod. 2. 55.

82. atris, ot the smoky flame of the
burning bitumen. With these two lines
cp. Virg. E. 8. 80-83.

83. sub haee, ‘immediately on hear-
hilldlesll'dddluillidiillflss
will curse her before he dies. The edi-
tors compare the behaviour oi Drusus
towards Tiberius in Tac. Ann. 6. 24
‘ubi exspes vitae suit meditatas compo·
sitasque diras imprecabatur?

85. dubius uncie, etc. His doubt
was Dido's, Virg. Aen. 4. 371 ‘Quae
quibus anteferam?'

86. Thyesteas, such as Thyestes

might have uttered against Atreus the
murderer of his children.

87, 88. No interpretation more satis·
sactory ou the whole has been offered of
these hard lines, than that suggested by
Lambinus, and adopted among recent
editors by Dina, and in its main points
by Munro. This makes ‘venena' in
the sense of φαρμακεῖαι, ‘veneficia' the
subject oi the sentence, and understands
an affirmative ‘valent' with the first
clause. ‘Sorceries may overset the
mighty laws of right and wrong, they
cannot overset the law os natural retri-
bution‚' ie. you may disregard divine
laws and kill me, hut Ι shall have my
tum yet. ‘Diris agam vos’ The merits
of this interpretation are that the parti-
cular expressions ‘convertere las nefas·
que' and ‘humanam vicem’ will har-
monise naturally. the first with Virgll’s
‘las versum atque neias’ G. 1. 505, the
second with Horace‘s own ‘vices super-
bae? Od. 1. 28. 32. We may notice the
additional parallel of ib. v. 34 ‘Teque
piacula nulla resolvent‘ to ‘dira detes·
tatio Nulla expiatur victima? Bentley
quotes aboOuTn'st. 3.1. 167 ‘ Humanae·
qne memor sortis quae tollit eosdem Et
premit, incertas ipse verere vices’ That
the constructionofthe sentencealthough
it is perhaps barsh sor Horace, is yet
Latin, Lambinus shows from Cic. ad
Att. 10. 1 ‘istum qui filium Brundisium
de pace misit¹ me legatum iri non arbi-
