HORATII CARMINUM

<Dio 54. 3), of a conspiracy with Fannius Caepio, and, in spite of the efforts of
‘Proculeium his brother (see on od. a. 2. 5), and Maecenas his brother-in-law’
(Dio l. e), was put to death. In the character given of him (ἀκράτῳ aul κατακορεΐ
παρρησίᾳ πρὸς aduror ὁμοίως ἐχρῆτο, see Dio 1. c.,who tells a story of his boldness
of speech towards Augustus himself) we may probably see the appropriateness of
Horace's persuasive to moderatiori.

On the argument drawn from this Ode as to the date of the publication of the
three Books,see1ntrod. to Books iiii, t 2.

RECTIUS vivae, Licini, neque altum

Semper urgendo neque, dum procellas

Cautus horresciS, nimium premendo
Litusiniquum.

Auream quisquis mediocritatem

Diligit, tutus caret obsoleti

Sordibus tecti, caret invidenda
Sobrius aula.

Saepius ventis agitatur ingens

Pinus et celsae graviore casu

Decidunt turres feriuntque summos
Fulgura montes.

Sperat infestiS, metuit secundis

Alteram sortem benc praeparatum

Pectus, Informes hiemes reducit
Iuppiter, idem

1. neque . ‚nequa not one any more
than the other.

altum urgendo, steering on and on
into the open sea. ,

3. nimium, with ‘premendo' ‘hug-
ging too close the dangerous shore.¹

5. auream mediocritatem, the μέ-
τριον, μέσον, so much praised in Greek
γνῶμαι, e. g. παντὶ μέσῳ τὸ κράτος θεὸς
ὤπασεν, Aesch. Eum. 529 ς πολλὰ μέ-
σοισιν ἄριστα· μέσοε θέλω ἐν πόλει εἶναι,
Phocyl. ap. Arist. Pol. 4. 11. Itis
here both the mean estate and the
moderatiou of mind which is content
with it.

6-8. fn point os grammar, doubtless,
‘tutus’ belongs to the first clause,
‘sobrius’ to the second; ‘he avoids the
meanness of a ruinous hovel arrd is saf ,

therefore safe' is the idea of the serr·
tenca, and neither adjective is confincd
to its own clause. The safety of mode·
ration is dwelt on further in the next
stanza, its prudence in the one follow·
ing. which suggests the mutability of
fortune.

7. invidenda, as Od. 3. 1. 45 ‘invi-
dendis postibus,’ in the same connec-
tion.

9-11. ingens, celsae, summos, all
in emphatic positione, ‘for their height .’
Cp. Herod. 7. 10 ὁρᾷς τὰ ὑπερέχοντα ζῶα
r‘us κεραννοΐὸ θεὸν οὐδὲ tat φαντάζεσθαι,
τὰ δὲ σμικρὰ οὐδέν μιν κνίζει· ὁρᾷς δὲ vie
έε οἰκήματα τὰ μέγιστα αἰεὶ καὶ δένδρεα
τὰ τοιαῦτ’ ἀποσκήπτει τὰ βέλεα.

13. infestis, secundis, ablative ab·
solute.

is soher and avoids the palace that 14. alteram semem, ‘a change uf
raises envy'3 but in sense, ‘sober and fortune!
