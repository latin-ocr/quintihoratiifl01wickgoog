external testimony will elicit other than an ambiguous answer from it.
In these, if to the end we must give full room to doubt, we can
hardly help balancing in our minds the frtness on other grounds
of the rival claimants.

Ι. MSS.

1. As has been already said, no MS. of Horace is knownto be in
existence older than the 9th century. We have, however, in the
edition of Cruquius (Antwerp, 1578), frequent testimony to the read-
ings of at least oue MS. of greater antiquity‚ the oue, namely, which
is known as the ‘Vetus Blandinius.’ ln preparing his edition, Cru-
quius had the benefit,of cousulring four MSS. then extant in the
Benedictine abbey of S. Peter, ‘in monte Blandinio’ (Blankenberg)‚
near Ghent. These MSS. all perished‚ as he tells us (see his note on
the Inscription to Sat. B. l, p. 308 of his Edition), in the sack of the
abbeyby arnob of‘iconoclasts,' in the outbreak of 1566. His own
estimare of their date puts thern all as early as the Mb century. One
whose loss he specially laurente, he distinguishes throughout from
the rest as ‘vetustissimus’ This is the MS. referred to in urost
editions as V. ¹

The general opinion of Horatian scholars, from Bentley onwards‚
has attached the very highest value to Cruquius' MS. Keller and
Holder‚ as will be seen, set less store by it. Its readings correspond
very largely with those of B (the old Bernese MS: see below) where
that is extant, and in the Satires and Epistles it is followed most

closely (especially in the famous variation Sat. 1. 6. 126 ‘campum

lusumque trigonam,’ where, with this one exception, it stands abso· ,

lutely alone) by a Gotha MS. of the r5th century, known as g. That
it was not free from interpolation, especially inthe Odes, is allowed
by those who rate it most highly, see eg. Od. 4. a. 6, where it reads
‘cum . . saliere,’ 4. 6. 21 ‘flexus' In aucha case as that noticed in
Sat. 1. 6. 126, there seem only three theorias possible 3 unless, with
Ritter, we can suppose that we have actually a δευτέρα φροντίς of the
poet, we must imagine a blotted half-line deliberately filled up either
in V (or its original), or in some one archetype to which all the other
MSS, and the copies which were interpreted in the Scholia, owe their
reading. J

a. The oldest Bernese MS.1(363 in the Public Library) was first
used hy Orelli in forming his text, and has since been re-collated
