HORATII CARMINUM

Seu rixam et insanos amores
Seu facilem, pia testa, somnum,
Quocunque lectum nomine Massicum
Servas, moveri digna bono die,
Descende, Corvino iubente
Promere languidiora vina.
Non ille, quamquam Socraticis madet
Sermonibus, te negleget horridus:
Narratur et prisci Catonis
Saepe mero caluisse virtus,
Tu lene tormentum ingenio admoves
Plerumque :dur03 tu sapientium

F ervidiore mero arcana promorat loco'
The two pairs seem to be (r) ol talk,
the outpouring of passionate complaints
or of mirth3 (a) os feeliogs, bitterness or
passion on the one side, peaeeiul slumber
ontbeother.

4. pia testa, ‘gentle wine-jar.' The
epithet apologises sor the calumnians
suppositions; contrast ‘impius clamor,’
1. 27. 6, and the torre oi 1. 18.

5. quocunque nornine, ‘to whatever
end’ (it sums up and repeats the pre·
ceding suppositions) ‘the Massic grapes
were gathered whose juice thou guard-
est.' ⁴ N omen’ meant the heading under
which an item was entered in an ac-
count, and so seems to have been used
sor a ‘ground’ ‘purpose’ ‘tendency'
Tac. Ann. 14. 59 ‘Decretae eo nomine
supplicationes' ‘on that account'; Cic.
de Am. 25 ‘multis nominibus est hoc
vitium notandum' ‘on many accounts?
‘under many heads' Bentley com·
plained that these and similar instances
hardly reach (as indeed they do not)
the use in this passage. and conjectured
‘numine' which has since been sonnd in
the Bam. MS.

Massicum 1.1. 19.

6. moveri, as in Epod.13.6‘vina..
move,' to disturb it, open the bin.

7. descende, from the ‘apotheca’
where it was exposed to the smoke. See
on 3. 8. 103 similarly ‘deripere horreo,'
3. 28. 7.

8. promere, constr. alter ‘iuben-
te'

languidiora, in a good sense,‘1uel·
lower'; 3. 16. 35,

9. madar=⁴imbutus est'; butas Mr.
Munro (on Lucr. 4· 792) observes, there

is a play on the literal and metaphorical
meaning. The sponge is so inll ol phi·
losophy, that there might be supposed
to be no room for the wine. ,

ro. sermonibus, not merely the -
Dialogues of Plato and others in which
Socrates is arr interlocutor‚ bnt talk on
the same model.

negleget. The MSS. and the Schol.
vary between the present and barne,
with the usual additional variety between
‘negligere' and ‘neglegere’ If not in
this stanza, at least in the next one. ‘tu
lene,’ etc. the particular cask has been
generalised into the representative of
wine in its enliverring eflects. The future
belps to susten the transition.

horridus, ‘he will not be so much
of a cynic as to despise thee)

11. Catonis, the censor. ‘Priscus’
is used of him almost as an addition to
his uame; see Plut. Cat. Mai. 1. Cp.
Epp. a. a. 116 ‘priscis memorata Ca-
tonibus! It has also been taken less
well of ‘ Cato Uticensis,' ‘ prisci' being
iuterpreted ⁴ old iashioned.’ ‘stem' Cic.
pro Cael. 14 ‘ severe et gravitaret prisce
agere!

12. virtue Catonis, as Sat. 2. 1. 7²
‘Virtus Scipiadae et mitis sa'entia
Laeli,' ‘Cato for all his virtue '3 see on
1. 3. 36.

13. lene tormentum. The meaning
seems to be settled by the parallel Epp.
1. 5. 19 ‘Fecuudi calices quem non
iecere disertum'l As the rach makes
the unwilling witness speak freely, so
wine makes the wit which is usually
stiff ancl taciturn become free arrd talk·
ativc, and yet love the tortore which is
thus applied to it.
