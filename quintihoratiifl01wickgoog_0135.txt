HORATII CARMINUM

Te Spes et albo rara Fides colit
Velata panno nec comitem abnegat,
Utcunque mutata potentes
Veste domos inimica linquis.
, At volgus infidum et meretrix retro
Periura cedit, diffugiunt cadis
Cum faece siccatis amici
Ferre iugum pariter dolosi.

nailsl Fewwill dispute the main propo-
sitions ofLessing's criticism; but we may
notice that Horace does not leave the
interpretation of the symbols to the
unassisted efforts of the mind. The
epithets are an integral part of bis
description, and they give at every tum
the moral ¹meaning which sculpture or
painting could only indirectly convey.
As Orelli remarks, ‘aena manu’ is an
addition which poetry only could have
ventured to make, for it involves a
metaphor within the metaphor. The
very sarneness from this point of view
has some force. Horace gives us a
very detailed picture, but in every lea·
ture he bids us see one aud the same
awlul character.

21. albovelata panno. The image
seems to be taken from the actual
custom which was observed by the
priests who sacrificed to Fides of veiling
their hand in a white eloth, the symbol
expressing apparently at once secresy
(contrast Od. 1. 18. 10 ‘Arcani Fides
prodiga pellucidior vitro ⁹) and guile-
lessness.

rara, i. e. rarely found. The epithet
really reminds us that loyalty is a
quality, and so *impairs the personi-
lication, cp. Od. 'a 16. 21.

aa. comitem abnegat, ‘denies thee
a companion,' ie. the only companion
whom she could deny, viz. herself.
Ovid, possibly in imitation, ‘Si qua
repugnarat nimium comitemquenegarat'
(sc. se), A. A. 1. 127. For the sing.
verb see on Od. 1. 3. 10.

apinianicae. lt can hardly be de-
nied that some confusion in the allegory
is brought to the surface by this epithet.
ln this stanza at least F ortune is not a
power wholly external to the person
who suffers or rejoices, but rather the
genius of his life. ‘mortalis in unum-
Quodque caput, vultu mutabilis.¹ This
is quite clear froru its first lines, for

Hope and loyal friends are said to cling
to her when she changes her garb and
leaves the horne of greatness Hope
and loyal friends are consolations of
adversity, so that Horace must mean
not that they go with Fortune when·
she deseris a man, but that they cling
to him, to his changed estate as to his
anchanged. Yet if this is the case, in
what sense is she said to be ‘inimica'l
On whom does she frown? A man
deserted by Fortune, suffering under the
illtreatment of Fortune, is a common
picture, but it is a conception of For-
tune which, is it suits the earlier stanzas
oi the Ode, is at variance with the
general tone ol this one. Fortune,
according to this, does not drive the
great man from his palace, nor fly from
him and leave him in it to calamity,
but goes with him. She ‘changes her
garb‚' but only as he would himself:
it is the common Roman habit ol
putting on a sad-coloured dress in a
time of missortune (cp. Epod. 9. 28
tpunico Lugubre mutavit sagum ’).

26. cadis siccatis, cp. the Greek
proverb ζεΐ χύτρα ζῇ φιλία.

28. ferre iugum pariter dolosi.
‘Ferre’ depends not on the whole idea
ol ‘ dolosi,' but on the positive attribute
which is denied in it. ‘Not honest in
bearing‚' ‘no loyal yoke-lellows.’ The
metaphoris common. The yoke some-
times, as perhaps here, has a reference
to the labours or troubles that friend-
ship shares and lightens. Aesch. Ag.
842 irorpos ἧν ἐμοὶ σειραφόρος, St. Paul,
Phil. 4. 3 adleyt γνήσιε, Ov. Trist.
5. 2. 39 ‘Me miserum quid agam si
Ξὲῗέἒῖῗλῗέἱῖἶῖιῗῗὲῧῗῗὲξοξώὲἑῖξῗ
times¹ as Theoc. 12. 15 ἀλλήλους ἐφί-
λησαν ἴσῳ (lya. it only refers to the
bond os Iove or friendship which is only
easy when both parties feel its weight
equally. ,
