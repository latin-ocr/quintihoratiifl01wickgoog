ODE XIV.

Tua sbip addressed has just escaped from a sturm, its mast broken, its hull
shattered, its sails in ribands. The harbour is iu sight. The wind is rising again.
It is warned not to drift back into a sea in which it cannot live. λ

Quintilian (8. d. 44) makes the Ode his illustration of the meaning of the term
‘allegoria' ‘Ut “O navis referent‚’' etc, totusque ille Horatii locus quo navem
pro republica, fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pace atque
concordia dicit? And the poem of Alcaeus, which looks like its model, was
believed by the aucients to be au allegorical description of the political troubles of
Mitylene :- ,

ἀσννέτημι τῶν ἄνεμον στάσιν·
τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἔνθεν κῦμο κυλίνδεται,
τὸ δ’ ἔνθεν· ἄμμες δ’ ἂν τὸ μέσσον ¹
νᾶϊ φοροΰμεθο σὺν μελαίνᾳ, f
χειμῶνι μόχθεντεο μεγάλῳ μάλα· .
περ μὲνγὰρ ἄντλος torcatum ἔχει,
λαῖφος δὲ πᾶν ζάδηλον ἤδη
rol λάμιδεο μέγαλαι κοτ’ adro. ⁵
χόλαισι δ’ ἄγκυραι . . ,
(Fr. 18 Bergk.)

As long as we are content with Quintilian’s general exposition, all is simple. The
allegory is satisficd when the commonwealth, in danger of relapsiug into civil war,
has become a sea-wearicd sbip, driftiug back into the storm. The masts, the sails,
the pine of Pontus, the Cyclades, belong to the sbip, and we must not look for
their exact couuterparts in the State. Here, as with other allegoricam are beset
with difficulties the moment we attempt to fit tbe details more erractly. It has
been argued, from vv. 17, 18, that Horace speaks of the ship as if be had himself
left it (but see notes on those verses), and that the subject of the Ode must,
therefore, be not the State but the Republican party. *Why others ask, is it a
Pontic plne, not some other—idean, perhaps, as more suitable to the mythical
origin of Rome? Acron suggested the answer, which has since been developed
into a whole theory of the purpose of the Ode. Pompey was the conqueror of
Mithridates of Pontus. The ship‚ therefore, represents the fortunas of bis son,
Sextus Pompeius, whom Horace would dissuade from embarking again in war
with Octavianus after the treaty of Misenum, rac. 39.

The difficulties of interpretation seemed so great to Muretus Dacier, and Bentley,
that they refused to allow the Ode to be allegorical at all.

On our view there will be nothing to fix it to a definite date. The ship is in
sight of harbour. This distinguishes the Ode from Epodes vii. and xvi. (see the
Introductions to them). 1 is not yet moored beyond the reach of the wind. So
long as the most timid politiciau could see in any movemeut a thought os renewed
resistauce to the rule which had saved Rome from anarchy, so long might Horace
have veuted his fears, or appealed to the fears of others by this allegory.
