HORATII CARMINUM

Cogor relictos: namque Diespiter,
igni corusco nubila dividens
Plerumque, per purum tonantes
Egit equos volucremque currum,
Quo bruta tellus et vaga flumina,
Quo Styx et invisi horrida Taenari
Sedes Atlanteusque finis
Concutitur. Valet ima summis
Mutare et insignem attenuat deus
Obscura promens3 hinc apicem rapax
Fortuna cum stridore acuto 15
Sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet.

5. Diespiter, a religione archaism‚
affected by Horace again in Od. 5. 2. 29:
cp.Varr. L. L. 5. 66 ‘antiquius Iovis
nornen: nam olim Diovis et Diespiter
dictus id est dies pater? So A. Geli. 6. 12
‘IovisDiespaterappeiiatusestidestdiei
et lucis pater‚’ and Macr. Satum. a. 15.
it is connected by them with the name
‘Lucetius’ given to him in the hymns oi
the Salii. It occurs probably in the
formula of the Fetiales, Liv. 1. 24 (see
Prol. Seeley's note). On the etymology
see Corssen, Anssprach. 1. 235: he re·
suses to allow the composition of a
Latin word by means oi a genitive case,
and therefore sees in Dies· a form os
the stem which also appears in the
Greek eri-irio-repos, and ‘with the Latin
change 01 s to r’ in ‘hodiernus'

7. plerumque. All the older com·
mentators who notice the point join
‘pierumque' with ‘egit' not perceiving
that Horace is speaking oi a single in·
stance in his own experiente. For the
emphatic position oi ‘plerumque' at
the end of its clause BentI. compares

purum, the cloudless sky; ‘sole
puro,’ Od. 5. 29· 45, cp. 5. ro. 8. Thun-
der, under such circumstances, is a
special portent in the poets; Hom. Od.

soli, Ov. Fast. 3. 370, etc.

11. Atlanteas fluis. Orelli quotes
rippoves Ἀτλαντικοὶ, Eur. Hipp. 3.

14. apicem seems to be used here,
andin Od. 3. ar. 30 ‘regum apices,’ for
the tiara ol eastern kings. It was the
name of the conical cap worn at Rome
by the ‘flamines’; see Virg. Aen. 8. 664,
and Conington¹s note on id. 2.683. Cicero
(Leg. 1. 1) uses it where Livy (1. 34)
uses ¹ pileus‚' in telling the story of the
eagle which snatched away and restored
the cap oi Tarquinius Priscus as he
approached Rome. It seems quite pos-
sible (as Lord Lytton argues) that even
ii Horace is actually thinking oi the
vicissitudes ol Phraates, he may be also
‘borrowing a metaphor to describe
them from a familiar Roman myth.¹

15. Fortuna, not apparently that he
attributes any moral purpose te For·
tune, as in the following Ode, or coor-
dinates her with ‘deus ' as an expression
oi the power that governs human lif .
It is only (as in Od. 5. 29. 49 foll.
where also we have her ‘rushing wings’)
the personification of the vicissitudes of
life, the eilect that we see, not the cause
which he has traced in the lines before.
