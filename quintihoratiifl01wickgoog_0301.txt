HORATII CARMINUM

Dicit et centum potiore signi-'s
Munere donat,

Flebili sponsae iuvenemve raptum

Plorat et vires animumque moresque

Aureos educit in astra nigroque
Invidet Orco.

Multa Dircaeum levat aura cycnum,

Tendit, Antoni, quotiens in altos

Nubiurn tractus. Ego apis Matinae
More modoque

Grata carpentis thyma per laborem

Plurimum circa nemus uvidique

Tiburis ripas operosa parvus
Carmina fingo

19. potiore signis. Pindar makes
the comparison himself, Nem. 5. 1 οὐκ
ἀνδριαντοποιός εἰμι . . ἀλλὰ γλυκεῖ’ ἀοιδὰ
στεῖχ’ ἀπ’ Αἰγίνας, κ,τ.λ.; so Horace,
Od.3.30.1‚4.8. 1-12.

21. flebili, ‘tearfuL' as ‘flebilis In0‚’

ve varies the ‘sive’ ‘sive’ of the last
two stamas although he is adding a
fresh department of poetry‚ viz. the
ippum. Cp. 1. 22. 5=7 ‘sive . .sive ..
ve .’

23. aureos is predicative, ‘as all
golden,' ‘painted as golden ’ ; cp. 1. 5. 9.
The double contrast of the bright stars

, above, the gloomy shades (⁴ all colours

are alike in the dark') below, is indicated
by the verb ⁴ educit‚’ on one side, by the
adjective ‘nigro’ on the other.

educit in astra, as ‘Musa vetat
mori: Caelo Musa beat,’ 4. 8. 27, of
immortality in fame.

25. muita aura; there is no fear of
tis salling3 the free and buoyant winds
of heaven are beneath him as he soars
into the upper air. Horace contrasts
Pindar’s higher flights and original in·
spiration with his own humble aims and
laborious imitativa method, ‘gathering
honey from flower to flower of Greek
tyrius, and enshrining it in the “curiosa
felicitas ’¹ of his own poetical style '; in
v. 29, ‘circa nemus . . Tiburis‚’ we geta
slightly different idea, ‘from vvood tn
wood of his Sabine neighbourhood? The
simile was introduced to express the

difference in genius and literary habits
between Pindar and Horace, but it sug·
gests to the poet his own wanderings in
the valley os the Anio. The Matinian
bee (save in its antitypa, the poet of
Venusia) has no business at Tibur.

ab. Antoni. As Orelli points out,
the name is repeated to mark the sum-
ming up and the praelicat conclusion.
‘Yon know, Antonius, the difference
between Pindar's powers and mine.
You will treat this high theme yourself
better thanI can?

thesis, as its position shows, to ‘grata'
Dina, after Bentley, joins ‘plurimum
nemus ¹; but the epithet would not be
very forcible (Bentley wished to escape
from it to ⁴ floreum '), and ¹ nemus ripas-
que uvidi Tiburis’ is athoroughly Hora·
tian arrangement.

31. onerosa parvus . . fingo, prob-
ably not without some reference back to
the first description of Pindar's poetry‚
its vast spontaneous rush, ‘immensus
