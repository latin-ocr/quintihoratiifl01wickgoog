Hostiliumque navium portu latent
Puppes sinistrorsum citae.

Io Triumphe, tu moraris aureos
Currus et intactas boves?

Io Triumphe, nec iugurthino parem
Bello reportasti ducem,

Neque Africanum, cui super Karthaginem 25
Virtus sepulcrum condidit.

Terra marique victus hostis punico
Lugubre mutavit sagum.

Aut ille centurn nobilem Cretam urbibus
Ventis iturus non suis,

Exercitatas aut petit Syrtes Noto,
Aut fertur incerto mari.

name as a war cry. The Scholiasts
quote Virg. Aen. 7. 698 ‘Ibant aequati
numero regemque canebant!

19, 20. These lines obviously describe
some naval defection which is matched
with the desertion os the Galatiae
cavalry. The meaning of ‘sinistrorsum
citac’ has not been fully explained.
Bentleysuggestedthat‘puppimciere,'=
‘to put the stern in motion‚’ may have
been a Latin equivaleut of πρύμναν apod-
εσθαι, ‘to back water? and that ‘sini-
strorsum’ may have had some technical
meaning as a completion ol the phrase;
or that Horace may be speaking as one
who looks at the scene os warham the
north, so that ⁶ to the left’ would mean
‘eastward’ ie. into the Ambracias
Gulr.

21. io Triumphe. ‘Triumphus' is
persenilied, as in Od. 4. 2. 49, see note
there. There isan emphasis on ‘tu‚'
‘It must be the Triumph-god himself
that delays the starting os the proces-
sion, all else is ready'

22. intactas, ‘never yoked: and so fit
sorsacrifice; ‘intacta cervice iuvencas,⁵
Virg. G. 4. 540, ‘grege de intacto
mactare iuvencos? Aen. 6. 38.

25. Africanum, sc. ‘reportasti parem
ducem! The ‘monument which his
valour built for him on the ruins of
Carthage' is ametaphorical monument.
Vell. Patere. may have had these lines
in mind when he wrote of Scipio Afri·
canus Minor ‘earn urbem funditus sus·
tulit lecitque suae virtutis monumentum
quod iuerat avi eius clementiae? The
reading ‘Africana’ sc. ‘bello,' found iu

some good MSS. seems to have arisen
inim a desire to make the construction
os the two clauses more symmetrical:
‘sepulchrum condere hello' in the sense
oi ¹ finem facere bello: is hardly an Hora·
tian metaphor; and, as Bentley remarks,
‘Africano‘ is not a distinctive epithet
enough for the war, we need ‘Punico'
The Jugurthine war was equally in
Africa. TheScholiastsinterpret‘super‚'
‘over against‚’ and have a mythical
story of an oracle desiring Scipio’s
bones to be removed irorn the Vatican
hill (they would have been in the tomb
of the Scipios on the Via Appia, not on
the Vaticani to a lomb at Ostia, ‘over
against Carthage.’

27. punico, a less usual form of
⁸ uniceo.’ Either scarlet or white was
ille proper colour os the ‘paludamen-
tum’ or general's eloah.

28. sagum was the eloah of the com-
mon soldier on service, opp. to ‘toga'
the dress of a citizen; as understood
with ‘punico' it loses irs special sense.
For the construction of 'mutavit’ with
gig accusative of the thing taken, see on

29, gal Three conjectures as to An-
tony’s flight. He is gone to Crete or
to Africa, or he is bearing about on the
sea. All these are qualided by words
to express his helpless state. 11 he
wishes to go to Crete he cannot com·
mand the winds: the Syrtes are ‘still
vexed’ by the south wind: the sea
drives him hither and thither.

51. petit governs ‘Cretam' as well
as ‘Syrtes’
