HORATII CARMINUM

Ni tuis victus Venerisque gratae
Vocibus divom pater annuisset
Rebus Aeneae potiore ductos

Alite muros,

Ductor argutae fidicen Thaliae,
Phoebe, qui Xantho lavis amne crinea
Dauniae defende decus Camenae,

Levis Agyieu.

Spiritum Phoebus mihi, Phoebus artem

Carminis nomenque dedit poetae.

21. vietus. The Old Bland. stands
alone in reading. apparently from a
gloss, ‘flexus’ The Comm. Cruq. him·
seli had read 'victua' and interprete it
by‘flexus.’

11. annuissem Virg. Aen. 1. 257
‘Parce metu, Cytherea; manent immota
tuorum Fata 111111 cernes urbem et pro-
missa Lavini Moenia?

23. rebus Aeneae, the fortunes ol
Aeneas aud his house, as ‘res Asiae‚’
Virg. Aen. 5. 1, 'res Troiae,’ Aen. 8.

potiore alite ς 1. 15. 5.

ductos, either 'carried along? ‘built'
or only ‘traced' See Conington on
Virg. Aen. 1. 425 ‘pars ducere rnu-
ros,²

25· argutae, Myrleiapredicative. She
learnt her clear singing, aa weil as her
harpplaying, of Apollo. Some MSS. 01
inferior velue have ‘Argivae' which was
intended to be antithetical 10 ‘ Dauniae’
=‘ Latinae'; see note on v. 28.

26. Xantho. The Lycian, not the
Trojan, Xanthus; 3. 4, 62. Virg. Aen. 4.
143,‘hibernamLyciamXanthiquefluenta
Deserit! Forthe practice ol introducing
into prayers the names ol the sacred
haunts of the god addressed cp. 1. 30. 1,
3. 26. 10, Apollo's long hair is at
once the sign of his perpetual youth <as
in v. 28 ‘levis' ie. ‘iniberbis¹) and part
01 the eostume of the hard i see Virg.
Aen. 1. 740 ‘crinitus Iopas’

27. Dauniae, in the first placedouht-
less, Horace's own Musa (cp. 3. 30. 10,
and ‘Calabrae Pierides’ of Ennius, 4. 8.
20), as is shown by the immediate trans·
ition to himself, ‘spiritum Phoebus
mihi,' etc. But it is not a purely local
designation. Horace would not have
said here ‘Venusinae Camenae? He

speaks of ‘Daunian blood' lor Roman⁴

or Italian in Od. 2. 1. 34. and uses the
Apulian aethe typical representative os
all Roman virtues (od. 5. 5. 9, 5. 16. 26,
Epod. 2. 42); audeo here the ‘Daunian
Muse’ is the ‘Italian Muse‚' though he
would remember the special appropriate-
ness of the local name, when the chosen
representative of Roman poetry is a
Daunian horn.

28. Agyieu. Ἀγυιεύς was a Greek
name of Apollo as guardian of streete,
ἀγυιαί, Aeseh. Agam. 1081, Arist. Vesp.
875. Ritter explains the choice of the
title by the lact that the Carmen Secu·
lare would be sung ‘sub di0.’ This
seems far-fetched. The associatione of
the name were to Horace, probably,
purely literary, and his purpose, as in
the first two lines of the stanza, is mainly
to make it clear that it is the Greek god
in all his attributes whom he clainrs es
the protector os his Daunian Muse (the
antithesis is present, though we need not
inv. 25 read ‘Argivae' to make it too
obtrusive); and to this end the tho·
{ltiilthihhtlthilli} 1111
unusual name makes great havoc among
the copyists. The Old Bland. has oddly
‘Laetus Agyllea!

29, 30. These verses form the transi-
tion to the last part of the Ode. He
has prayed to Phoebus the Greek god
01 poetry, to defend from disgraoe,
through failure os the poet or perlormers
or audience, the honour of the Italian
Musa. ι1101, it is Phoebus that in·

task' Strong in that persuasion‚ he
calls on the chorus to obey and iearu
