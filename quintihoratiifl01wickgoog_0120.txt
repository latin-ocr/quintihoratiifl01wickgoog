ODE XXIX.

‘Wuar⁵ Iccius hankering aster the treasures 01 Arabia, and planning eastern
conquests? Have you chosen already your share 01 the sppil? Who will say
again that aught in nature is impossible, when Iccius the scholar sells his library
to buy armour and belies the promise 01 his life l’

Iccius is unknown to us except from this Ode arrd Epp. 1. 12. In that Epistle,
written probably about fiv'e years afterwards he has resumed his peacelul pursuits,
is he ever left them, and is engaged as manager 01 Agrippa's estates in Sicily.
We must not take Horace's banter here or his imputation 01 avaricious motives as
serious. Some readers see in the opening lines of the Epistle a hint 01 105110550055
111 Iccius' disposition, but Horace speaks os him asa man 01 singularly temperate
1110 and a rare example 01 1110 possibility 01 mainta'pring a pure and lofty taste
‘inter scabiem et contagia lucri.’

In the year 24 ac. AelIus Gallus made an unsuccessful expedition into Arabia
Felix. The Ode will probably have been written when the preparations for it
had begua, but these seem 10 have lasted some time; see on Od. 1. 35. 30.
