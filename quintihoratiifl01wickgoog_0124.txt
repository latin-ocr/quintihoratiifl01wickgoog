LIB. Ι.

OD. 31.

Armenta, non aurum aut ebur Indicum,
Non rura, quae Liris quieta
Mordet aqua taciturnus amnis
Premant Calena falce quibus dedit
Fortuna vitem, dives et aureis
Mercator exsiccet culullis
Vina Syra reparata merce, Ι
Dis carus ipsis quippe teret quater»r
Anno revisens aequor Atlanticum =

wealth, large cattle farms; cp. Od. a.
16. 33 ‘Te greges centum Siculaeque cir·
cum Mugiuntvaccae,’etc.; Epp. a.2.117
‘Quid vici prosunt aut horrea? quidve
. Calabris Saltibus adiecti Lucanif’
grata, ‘pleasant’ to own or to see.
6. A villa adorned with gold and

ivory; cp. Od. a. 18. 1 ‘Non ebur neque ,

aureum Mea renidet in domo lacunar!

7. rura, i.e. as the next stanza shows,
the wine-growing lands through which
the Liris (now the Garigliano) flows. On
the left bank os the Liris, as it nears the
sea, is the Ager Falernus, and at a short
distance the Mons Massicus.

8. mordet, Lucret. 5. 257 ‘ripas
radentia flumina rodunt!

9. ‘Let who may own rich vineyards
at Cales, l grudge them not!

premant = ‘reprimant' cbeck the
luxuriant growth; Virg. G. 1. 156 ‘ruris
opaci Falce premes umbram.’ The
words are probably meant to imply the
ricbness ol the soil and luxuriance of
the vines. Cales was a town in the
north os Campania. Its wine is named
in Od. r. 20. 9, 4. 12. 14.

(lalana falce (cp. 3. 6. 58) involves a
slight hypallage, i.e. the adjective would
more naturally go with ‘vitem' ‘At
Cales¹ is the simple meaning. When
for the local case or adverb an adjec-
tive is substituted‚ there are possibly

¹ several words in the sentence with

which it may without positive impro-
priety be made to agree. The prose
writer chooses the most obvious, the
poet very likely the least obvious.

ro. vitem, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, with ‘premant'
and ‘dedit’

at. Some good MSS. (including B)
have ‘ut,’ which also stands in the
lemma of Porph. ll we read ‘ut' there
is a taunt against the wine-grower who

toils that other men may drink of his
wine, as well as against the trader who
risks his lile sorbis gold cups and rare
wines. The irony would be not un-
likely to attract an emendator, but it
seems beyo the requirements of this
place. W want the ‘exsiccet' ‘let
him drain‚’ that Horace may acquiesce
in the good fortune oi the trader, even
if he afterwards undervalues it.

11. exsiccet, ‘curn aliqua aviditatis
significatione,' Orell.

culullis, A. P. 434, apparently used
for ‘large cups’ According to the
Schol. they were originally ‘calices
fictiles quibus pontifices virginesque
Vestales in sacris utebantur!

ra. Syra reparata meroe, obtained
by bartering Syrian wares. The mean·
ing of ‘reparo ' seems to be ‘to obtain
in erchange} the ‘ re' playing the part
of ἀπὸ in ἀποδίδοσθαι, ‘to give for a
consideration‚¹ ἀπαιτεῖν, etc. Forcell.
quotes iorthe use two fragments of
Alfenus Marus and Scaevola contained
in the Digest, ‘alios boves his nurnis
reparare‚’ ⁴ messes reparare‘; see on Od.
1. 37. 24 ‘latentes Classe cita reparavit
oras’ Bentley, denying this use of
‘reparo' alters that passage and inter·
prets this, ‘condita vel medicata Syriaco
nardo,¹ referring to the Roman practice
of mining spices and perfumes with cer-
tain wines. For the ‘Syrian wares’ cp.
Od. 3. 29. tio ‘Tyriae merces! These
would consist of the produce of the
East, amongst them of spices and per·
fumed oils. ‘Assyria nardo‚’ a. 11.16;
‘Malobathro Syrio‚' 2. 7. 8.

13. Dis carus ipsis, ‘I don’t envy
the trader his wealth, and yet he surely,
if any one, must be a favourite (nors
like the Campanian vine-grewen of
Fortuna, but) of the gods themselves,
