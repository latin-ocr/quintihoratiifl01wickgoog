‘Now is the time ior merriment and thanksgiving‚ private and public; now, and
not before, while the great queen was plotting wild schemas of destruction against
Rome. Her madness tras cooled at the sight os her fleet in flames. Blind panio

barbaric queen, her recklessness and her fortitude. he is bringing out in stronger
relies the danger from which Rome has been freed, and the glory of Octauianus
who has conquered no unworthy loe.

The opening ol the Ode was doubtless modelled on the Ode oi Alcaeus upon the
death ol Myrsilus (Fr. ao, Bergk), of which we have two lines preserved in Athen.
