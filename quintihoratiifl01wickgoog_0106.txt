Or the person whose death is the subject of this Ode we know nothing but what
is contained in the statement of the Chronicon of Eusebius (nn. 264-340), which,
opposite the year nuc. 730,13.c. ²4· has (in the Latinversion uf Jerome) ‘Quin-
tilius Cremonensis Vergilii et Horatii familiaris moritur.' We may notice that the
mention of Cremona makes him'a neighbour of Virgil. The Scholiasts on Horace
eall him Quintilius Varus, and add that he was a Roman knight‚ identifying him
with the Quintilius of A. P. 458. see on v. 8, and with Varus of Od. 1. 18.

The Ode is not merely, asPorph. describes it, ‘Opiros in Quintilium sodalem Ver-
gilii? The Pseudo-Aer. characterizes it more justly, ‘Consolatur Vergilium impa-
tienter amici sui mortem lugentem? Horace¹s feeling is for Virgil as much as for
their common friend. From this point of view we must be struck by the delicacy
of the ‘consolation' He justifies Virgil's grief, he shares it. ‘He too will join in
the dirge; Quintilius is gone, the peerless, the soul of modesty, honour, justice, and
truth! All good men weep; and who has greater right to weep than Virgll¹
whose piety and trustluluess the gods have so hardly rewarded'? Only at last,

when he has opened his friend’s beart by his expression of sympathy, does he '

uenture on a hint, not perhaps of comfort, but of sels-restraint. ‘After alt, no
laments, though sweeter than Orpheus, no prayers, will reaeh the dead. lt is acruel
fate, patience only will lighteu what may not be cured’

It would seem, if Donatus be giving a genuine trait os Virgil in his Life, c. 18,
that Horace is recalling his friend tobis own philosophy for consolation: ‘Solitus
erat dicere nullam virtutem commodiorem homini esse patientia, ac nullam adeo
asperam esse fortunam quam prudenter patiendo vir fortis non vinem?
