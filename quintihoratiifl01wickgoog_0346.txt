LIB. IV.

OD. 15.

iniecit emovitque culpas
Et veteres revocavit artes
Per quas Latinum nom-en et Italae
Crevere vires famaque et imperi
Porrecta maiestas ad ortus
Solis ab Hesperio cubili.
Custode rerum Caesare non furor
Civilis aut vis exiget otium,
Non ira, quae procuditenses-
Et miseras inimicat urbes
Non, qui profundum Danubium bibunt,
Edicta rumpent Iulia, non Getae,

and double gateway (Burn's Rome, pp.
xxiv and 87), which was opened in time
ol war and closed in time of peace, was
‘Ianus Quirinus? ‘Quirinus’ being ap-
parently an adjective, as in ‘lanus Ge·
minus‚' ‘ Ianus Iunonius,' etc. It is open
therefore to suppose eitherthat the geni·
tive was used indifferently with the ad·
jective as=‘ 01 Romulus' (to whom the
worship 01 Janus was attributed), ‘of
Rome,' ‘Romam' or that Horace con·
sciously varies the usual form, as he
does technical expressions so ostem see
011 5. 5. 42.

10. frenatioenttae iniectu 3. 1419.

re. ortes3 ‘Imperium facile his arti·
bus retinetur quibus initio partum est,'
Sall. Cat. 2. 4. They are the virtues 01
old Roman lile celebrated in 3. 1-6.
For ‘artes'cp 3. 329 ‘Hac arte Pollux‚’
etc. As Kritz explains on the passage
in Sallust, the word only=‘studia ac
mores'andmust draw its positivecolour
from the context. We need not think,
with many ol Horace's editors, 01 the
possibleetymologicalconnectiouof‘ars’
with ἀρετή. 11 the end proposed were
bad, ‘artes' would be vices.

14. 1111110113 see on 1. 2. 16.

15. ortus. There is a, v. l. 01 less
authority, ‘ortum’ It isa case clearly
where either singular or plural is admis-
sible, and where variety is quite a suili-
cient motive to account lor their inter·
change. Bentley quotes Sall. Cat. 36
‘cum ad occasus ab ortu solis omnia
domita armis parerent!

17. eustode3 3.14. 15, 4. 5. 1.

18. exiget, in its simple sense, ‘drive
out‚' as ,1. 13. 31 ‘exactos tyrannos.⁵
B bas ‘hrigit’5 V, unmetrically, ‘exe-

git' Some sorm of the verb was cer·
tainly read by Porph, who interprets
‘excludet 01111ἰέξο agit, ut Terentius:
spectdndue cm exigendae? There is good ..
MS. authority also for ‘eximet' which
is preferred by Ritter, Keller, and Mt.
Munro; and it is a common Horatiae
word, Od. 2. a. 19, 5.14. 14, Epp. 1. 5.
18, a. 2. ara, though this is, hardly an
argument 101 11 here.

ao. miseras, proleptically ‘to their
miser .'

1111111011, ‘sets at variance‚' a word,
apparently, as Porph. tells us (‘fictunr
verbum est '), coined by Horace.

21. For the ionn 01 expressibn see
on 3. 10.1; cp. 2. a. ao‘Rbodani'poton’
The peoples meant may be either the
Vindelici (4. 4. 18), against whom Tibe·
rius ltad won some victories, or the
Daci (3. 6. 13,Virg. G. 2. 497 ‘coniurato
descendens Dacus ab Istro‘), who used
to be spoken of as dangerous in the
early years oi Augustus' reign.

22. edicta Iutta. We must no more
look foratechnical meaning in ⁶ edicta,'
than 101 exact historical facts to curres·
pond with the general statement. ‘Edic-
tum' though limited very much in use
to the praetor's edicts, was a general
term 101 any command issued by a
magistrate. The form of the phrase is
intended to recall ‘ leges Iuliae,' the name
which covered the domestic legislation
01 Augustus as well as Julius. The
substance, so far as it had any which
can be realised, would be terms of
plpaca which pinguetus has imposed on

e various na ons.
