ODE XII.

‘Wrrrrnn is past, and Spring reigns again. The ice is gone, the swallow builds,
shepherds sing their songs in the open air. Come, then, Virgilius, and inaugurate
the thirsty season witha eask ol the best wine 1 can get you. But you shall not
come empty handed ; you bring the ointurent ii I find the wine. Above all, come
with amiud void escars, and prepared for free enjoyment!

The chief interest of the Ode centres in the question to whom it was addressed.
It is a playlul letter actually sent by Horace on some occasion to the great poet,
and published six years aiter his death, not so much sor its intrinsic merits as for
its reminisccnces ol their friendship? On this theory (and it is held by Dilis and
was held by Bentley), we may expect there to be allusions in it which are now nn-
intelligible, though they would probably be well understood by Maecenas and the
many survivors of the literary circle in which Virgil and Horace met. Dbring
who also takes this view, points out that the images of the first three stanzas have

'a special appropriateness as addressed to a poet, and the poet os the Bucolics and
Georgics. The chief difficulties in the way of the theory, apart from the absence
oi any tradition on the subject (lor the Scholiasts all imagine some other Virgilius
to be intended), lie in expressions of v. 15 ‘iuvenum nobilium cliens: and v. 25
‘studium lueri! Ol course fflese can be disposed ol as covering meanings to which
we have lost the lreyr but it is rather hard to imagine any possible meanings,
‘Pone moras et studium lucri‚’ is exactly the style in which Horace would address
one of his ordinary friends engaged in the common pursuits of the day3 but what
can it mean addressed to Virgill We cannot really reser it to the proposed
exchange oswine sor nard, and take it to mean, ‘Don't baggle about the bargain!
‘Iuvenum nobilium cliens: again, is natural enough and complimentary enough,

nobility. in the best sense, ol the patrons; but at what period ol Virgil's life could
it have sounded like a complimeut? Macleane is content with the Scholiast’s sug·
gestion that Augustus and Maecenas are the ‘iuvenes'3 but he can scarcely have
really thought that the possibility oi such an expression was proved by Horace's
calling Augustus 'iuvenis' in 1. a. 41. There is, perhaps, a small indication that
