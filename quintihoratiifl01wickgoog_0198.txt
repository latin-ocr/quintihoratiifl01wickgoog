LIB. ΙΙ. OD. 20.

Dilecta, Maecenate, obibo
Nec Stygia cohibebor unda.
Iam iam residunt cruribus asperae
Pelles, et album mutor in alitem

Per digitos humerosque plumae.

Visam gementis litora Bospori

Noscent Geloni, me peritus
Discet Hiber Rhodanique potor.
Absint inani funere neniae s
Luctusque turpes et querimoniae;
Compesce clamorem ac sepulcri
Mitte supervacuos honores.
