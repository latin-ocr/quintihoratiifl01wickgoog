HORATII CARMINUM

¹ Iam bis Monaeses et Pacori manns
Non auspicatos contudit impetus
Nostros et adiecisse praedam
Torquibus exiguis renidet.
Paene occupatam seditionibus
Delevit Urbem Dacus et Aethiope,
Hic classe formidatus, ille
Missilibus melior sagittis.
Fecunda culpae secula nuptias Ἴ
Primum inquinavere et genus et domos;
Hoc fonte derivata clades
In patriam populumque fluxit.
Motus doceri gaudet Ionicos
Matura virgo et fingitur artibus3

9. bis Monaeses et Pacori manus.
Three defeats of Roman armies hythe
Parthians are recorded-that of Crassus
at charrae by Surenas, ac. 53 ; that ol
Decidius Saxa, legatus of M. Antony,
in Syria by Pacorus the son of Orodes,
and Labienus the republican renegade,
in ac. 4o; and that ol M. Antony in
Media in nc. 36. Pacorus himself had
been killed in battle in rao. 38. The only
Monaeses known to history was the Par-
thian noble who, having fied, like many
others, from the tyranny of Phraates IV
(the son to whom Orodes Iin his gn'ef
at the death ol Pacorus had resigned
the eroum), instigated Antony to his
ill-advised invasion ol 'Parthia in uc. 56.
It has been suggested that Monaeses
may have been the name ol the general
who defeated Crassus, ‘Surenas' being
not so much n name as a title, as it
appears to have been certainly in later
times: Σουρήνας . . ἀρχῆς δὲ τοῦτο παρὰ
Πέρσαις ὄνομα, Zosimus (ao. 400-450).
Estre would cut the knut by condemn·
· ing the stanna. Probably Horace is
thinking of the two greater defeats-oi
Crassus and Antony—and Monaeses and
Pacorus are merely representatives of
the Parthians.

to. non auspicatos (in some good
MSS. ‘inauspicatos '). Bentley objected
to the series of accusatives as prosaiu
and would read ‘nostris' or ‘nostro-
rum'; but ‘non auspicatos’ is not an
epithet, but predicative: it gives the
reason oi the defeats and is the link

with the last stanza. It was especially
mentioned ol Crassns' expedition that
‘proficiscentem in Syriam diris cum
ominibus tribuniplebis frustra retinere
conati‚¹ Vell. Pat. 2. 46. =

13. paene, with ‘delevit’ ‘While
we were intent on our civil wars the
barbarians ol north and south all but
destroyed Rome.' a poetical exaggera-
tion. For the Daci see Introd. to Books
iniis 7.

14. Aethiops represents the Egyptian
fleet ol Cleopatra; cp. Virgil's account
of the rout at Actium, Aen. 8. 705
‘omnis eo terrore Aegyptus et Indi,
gnssnismrabs, omnes vertebant terga

a aer.

17. fecunda eulpae, sor the gen.
cp. ‘ferax frondis? 4. 4. 58.

seorsim it has been a gradual decien-
sion from age to age.

18. genus et domos, the young
generalion has vice in its blood, and
sees examples ol vice in its homes.

20. patriam populumque. Il any
distinction is intended, it is between the
life and honour of the state as affected
by defeat in war, etc, and the well-being
of its individual citizens.

21. motus Ionicos, voluptuous
Ionian dances.

aa. artibus, instr. abl. as ‘formatur‚'
‘eruditur artibus’3 ‘accomplishments' ;
4. 1. 15 ‘centurn puer artium‚' though
here with aless honourable meaning.
A large number of good MSS. read
‘artubus’
