202 HORATIl CARMINUM

Cervici iuvenis dabat,
Persarum vigui rege beatior.
Donec non alia magis
Arsisti neque erat Lydia post Chloen,
Multi Lydia nominis
Romana vigui clarior'llia.
Me nunc Thressa Chloe regit,
Dulces docta modos et citharae sciens,
Pro qua non metuam mori,
Si parcent animae fata superstiti.
Me torret face mutua
Thurini Calais filius Ornyti,
Pro quo bis patiar mori,
Si parcent puero fata superstiti.
Quid, si prisca redit Venus
Diductosque iugo cogit aeneo,
Si flava excutitur 'Chloe
Reiectaeque patet ianua Lydiae?

commentatore when they say that he is
referring here, not to the Parthians, but
to the old Persian monarchy.

5. alia arsisti ; a. 4. 8 ‘arsit virgine?

7. multi Lydia nominis, not as
though literally the world knew her
name; but she felt as proud os his
preference as if she had a same equal
to that os ilia. Ritter, identifying the
lover with Horace, would make it mean,
'your poems were lull of Lydia, and
gave her a fame as great as lliu’s.’ For
' the genitive ‘nominis’ see Madv. ξ 287.

8. Romana, the ancestress of Rome
(as the mother of Romulus, according
to one form of the legend; cp. 1. a. 17).
The epithet indicates the source aud
the extent oi her fame; possibly it is
further intended to adapt the comparisou
to the mouth of a Greek.

10. citharae seiens3 1. 15. 24 ‘pug-

person. I cau tell you all about him is
you wish, as well as you can tell me of
Chloe and her charms.’ Cp. 3. 12. 6.
Thurii seems to be selected forits old
reputatiou of wealth and luxury; the
others are mythological names, chosen
‘ut poetica et sonora} Orelli. ‘Orny-
tus' is used by Virg. Aen. 11. 677.

16. puero. It is not quite easy to
see the point os Lydia¹s variation from
‘animae' It may be merely for variety's
sake. Possibly, however, ‘animae'
taken in connection with the early lines
of the stanza, which had not touched a
very deep chord, might have seemed
conventional, and have provoked the
simpler aud more personui, and so more
feeling ⁴ puero’

strength; ‘irrupta copula,’ 1. 13. 18.
