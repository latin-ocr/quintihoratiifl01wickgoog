HORATII CARMEN SECULARE.

Nutriant letus et aquae salubres

Et Iovis aurae.

Condito mitis placidusque telo ⁴
Supplices audi pueros, Apollo;
Siderum regina bicornis, audi,

Luna, puellas:

Roma si vestrum est opus, Iliaeque
Litus Etruscum tenuere turmae,
Iussa pars mutare Lares et urbem

Sospite cursu,

Cui per ardentem sine fraude Troiam
Castus Aeneas patriae superstes
Liberum munivit iter, daturus

Plura relictis:

Di, probos mores docili iuventae,
’ Di, senectuti placidae quietem,
Romulae genti date remque prolemque
Et decus omne!

the Ambarvalia, the festival when the
sickle was to be putto the eorm see
the description in Tibull. a. 1, and cp.
v. 3 ‘ Spicis tempora cinge, Ceres? The
Fratres Arvales wore as a badge of
office a chaplet of wheat·ears; ‘Spicea
corona,' Plin. N. H. 18. a.

32· Iovis, the god of the air; Od. 1.
1. 25, etc.

33. condito telo; od. a. ro. 19
‘neque semper arcum Tendit Apollo’
His arrows carried pestilence (Hom. ll.
1. 50 foll), so that it isa condition of
the sulfilment ol the prayer of the last
stanza. Macleane remarks that the
statues of Apollo Actiacus, which An-
gustus had dedicated in his new temple
on the Palatine. represented him in a
bard‘s dress and with a lyre, although
on the promontory of Actium he stood
with a drawn bow. Cp. Virg. Aen. 3.
274, 8. 704 with Propert. 3. 43. 5, 6 and
15.16.

35. bicornis recalls her formas she
is represented on medals, etc, with the
crescent on her forehead.

37 foll. In the first clause the idea is
put simply, ‘Rome is your handiwork';
in the following clauses the same idea is
suggested hythe emphatic words ‘Iliae'
(Rome is a colony of Troy, aud Apollo

and Artemis were guardians of Troy),
‘iussa’ ‘sospite' (under divine sale·
guard), ‘ castus’ (and so under the pro·
tection of the goddess oi chastity). Com·
rr rueretru-sertin
trast between the ‘remnant’ preserved
and the guilty city destroyed: ‘Castus . .
patriae superstes'; therestwere‘incesti’
(see 3. 3.19 and 23). That there is a
moral meaning here at least, is clear
from the petition in which this appeal
ends, ‘Di probos mores,' etc.. the
character of Aeneas, not oi Paris, and
therefore the old age of Aeneas, not ol
Priam.

38. litus Etruscum Od. 1. a 14,
Epod.16.4o.

41. sine fraude3 Od. a. 19. 20.

44. plura relictis, ‘more than all
they left behind‚’ Rome instead of Troy.

45, 46. docili, placidae. Both are
predicative. but some variety is obtained
by their different relation to the aecusa-
tive. The ‘docility' is a condition of,
or at least a prior gift to, the gift of
‘honest lives'; the ‘calm’ ol temper
follows the gift of external quiet.

47. Romulae3 see Od. 4. 5. r, and
0111. 15.10. For the elislon of ‘que’
at the epd of the line ep· Od. 4. r. 22, 23.
