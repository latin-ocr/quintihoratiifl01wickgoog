COMPLEMENTARY INFINITIVE. 381

perire,’ ‘piger ferre': it may cause some ambiguity when the negative
character of the adjective is less clear, or where it would have been
equally open to the poet to regard it from its positive side, and to
make the infinitive the complement of the whole, not merely of the
positive part, viz. the attribute denied or disparaged. Contrast, eg,
‘ferre iugum pariter dolosi' with ‘cautum dignos assumere,' ‘calli-
dum condere,' etc.; (b) in sucb cases as the last three given above,
u‘lrere the adjective and the infinitiva seem to have changed places,
where it is no longer an internal quality of the'subject leading to some
action, but an action which is the cause or ground of the attribute, uo
longer ‘brave so as to conquer,’ but ‘famous because he conquers'
‘Nireus videri,’ Od. 4. a. 59 (like ‘nefas vide1·e,' Epod.16.14)‚
seems to be more purely an imitation of a Greek idiom (λεῦκος ὁρᾶσθαι,

ἀθέμιτον ἰδεῖν).
