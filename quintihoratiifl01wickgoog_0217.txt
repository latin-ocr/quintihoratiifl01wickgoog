HORATII CARMINUM

Finire quaerentem labores
Pierio recreatis entre.
Vos lene consilium et datis et dato
Gaudetis, almae. Scimus, ut impios
Titanas immanemque turmam
Fulmine sustulerit caduce,
Qui terram inertem, qui mare temperat 45
Ventosum, et urbes regnaque tristia
Divosque mortalesque turbas

Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 5 of the retired gladiator,
'latet abditus agro? Orelli, following
B, has ‘addidit' which is used in the
same connection, as if it were the tech-
nical word, in Tac. Ann. 15. 31 ‘Colo-
niae Capua atque Nuceria additis veter·
anis firmatae suut! Bentley supporta
‘reddidit' (which also has respectable
MS. authority) by Tac. Ann. Ι. 17 ‘prae-
torias cohortes quae post sedecim annos
penatibus suis reddidit? ln point of
sense, ‘abdidit' or ‘reddidit ' are much
preferable to ‘erluidis’ as helping the
, general idea that the war is over. It is
the soldiers, not the towns, that Horace
is thinking of. ‘Addidit' views the

' action from the side of the towns.

41. consilium, a trisyllabis, the
penult. being lengthened before l, and
the semiconsonantal i= y. So in 3. 6. 6
‘Hinc omne principium? Cp. Virgil’s
use of ‘tenuia’ G. 1. 597; ‘fluviorum’
ib. 482‚etc.

dato gaudetis almae. They not
only give gentle counsels but when they
have given them they rejoiee to further
them; for in respect to them, as in all
other respects¹ they are ‘almae' This
epithet stands last, es summing up the
beneficent character of the Muses which
hasbeen the theme of the first half of
theone, and as leading us by the asso-
ciation os eontrast to the impersonations
“ ol brute and insensate force, whose vain
efforts and doom are the subject of the
latterhalf.

42. seimus ut, ‘we all know how.’
The preceding stauzas have been profes·
sedly addressed to the Muses. ‘Scimus’
reminds us that it is really a homily
addressed to Horace's contemporaries,
who had witnessed, so he hints, a repeti·
tion of the Gigantomachia. The same
comparison is hinted in Od. a. rr.
o-1o.

43. immanemque, the ‘que' adding
only another designation of the same
Obieleije must go by a mere majority of
older MSS. we must read ‘turbam’

¹ here, and ⁴ turmas’ in v. 47.

44. caduco, καταιβάτης κεραυνός,
Aesch. P. V. 358. Here, as iu r.13.11,
the adjective has something of that sense
of ⁴ proneness to fall‚’ which Bentley (ad
lec.) rightly holds to be proper to it.
The bolt hung ready to fall: a touch
lanndred it. The adjective heightens
our feeling ef the ease with which the
Titans were swept away. Bentley con·
demna it here, as merely equivalent to
‘cadente' and would therefore alter it to
‘corusca' which would hardly be an
epithet of sufficient point to occupy the
emphatic place.

45-48⁴ The universality ol Jove’s
rule is indicated not only hythe nerins
‘terram' ‘mara’ etc. which describe his
triple empire in earth, in Hades, in
heaven, but also by the triple contrast
of the epithets expressed or implied:
the ‘dull earth' (⁴bruta‚’ 1. 34. 9) and
the ‘sea stirred by every wind) ‘the
[busy] cities ot the living and the sad
realrn of the shades‚' ‘the [⁴ quieti or·
dines’ of the] gods and the turinoil of
morta] men? However mueh they differ
in all else, they are all alike subject to
his sway. For Horace’s manner of
marhing a contrast by giving an epithet
to one only of the two things contrasted
{retineant tttatrttnltt
all such as imply some difficulty or un-
lihelihood in the way of his rule. He
can sway the earth, however insensate
it be3 the sea, however stormy3 the sad
strahow-world, as well as the world of
mem the turmoil of earth, as well as
the quiet gods.
