HORATII CARMINUM

Natalis horae, seu tyrannus
Hesperiae Capricornus undae,
Utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
Consentit astrum. Te Iovis impio
Tutela Saturno refulgens
Eripuit volucrisque Fati
Tardavit alas, cnm populus frequens
Laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum:
Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset, Mercurialium
Custos virorum. Reddere victimas 30

19. tyrannus Hesperiae undae, cp.
Propert. l. c. Horace probably gives this
title (cp. ⁸ arbiter Hadriae* 1. 5. 15) to
Capricom as the mid-winter sign. Cic.

that in suggesting Capricom for their
horoscope Horace is thinking of his
narrow escape from shipwreck, Od. 3.

aa. impio connects the crimes of the
mythological Saturn with the bad influ-

23. Saturno. Orelli and Dillr. seem
right iu thinking that the dative feels
the government both of‘eripuit’ and ol
‘refulgens’ in the sense of ‘shining in
the face ol‚’ so as to counteract his in·
fluence.

ab. ter, indefinite, of several rounds
of applause. The plural ‘theatris’
generalizes, ‘the people in crowded
theatres’; in Od. 1. ao. 3, where he re·
fers to the event ruore particularly, he
uses the singular. We need not press
the fact that there was at the time
apparently only one theatre in Rome.
Ritter thinks it necessary to join ‘laetum
theatris’=‘quo gaudent theatra’ For
the phrase ‘crepuit sonum ’ cp. Propert.

sonos.⁹

rhetorical exaggeration ‘I was dead,

identified with Pan, for Pan was the
son of Hermes. which may explain the
connection of ‘ Mercurialium! Horace
attributes his escape in 3. 8. 7 to Bac·

ences to it is its ground, ‘Dis pietas
