ODE XV.

Tau subject is the same as that of 1. 25 and 4. 13, the odionsness and ridiculous·
ness of the desires and ways of youth kept on when youth itsell has departed.
The spirit is rather that of the Epodes (⁸ Archilochio felle,' Mitsch.) than os the
Odes; possibly a real person may be pointed at. Meineke suggested that the name
‘Nothus’ a name unknown to exstant ¹Greek literature, was the poetical represen-
tative ol the common Latin ‘Spu1·ius‚‘see1ntrod. to a. 4. '

Chloris is warned that she is at once old and poor. ‘It is time to give up her
wauton ways. What suits her daughter Pholoe' does not suit her. She is the wile
oi a poor man, let her take her wool and spin. That will be more becoming to
her than the harp and the wine-cup?

UXOR pauperis Ibyci,

Tandem nequitiae fige modum tuae
F amosisque laboribus:

Maturo propior desine funeri
Inter ludere virgines

Et stellis nebulam spargere candidis

Et te, Chlori, decet: filia rectius
Expugnat iuvenum domos,

Pulso Thyias uti concita tympano.
Illam cogit amor Nothi

Te lanae prope nobilem

Tonsae Luceriam, non citharae decent
Nec ilos purpureus rosae 15

Nec poti vetulam faece tenus cadi.
