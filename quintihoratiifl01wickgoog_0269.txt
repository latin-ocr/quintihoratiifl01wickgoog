HORATII CARMINUM

Fruges et Cererem serunt,
Nec cultura placet longior annua,

Defunctumque laboribus

Aequali recreat sorte
Illic matre carentibus

vicarius

Privignis mulier temperat innocens,

Nec dotata regit virum

Coniux nec nitido lidit adultero
Dos est magna parentium
Virtus et metuens alterius viri

Certo foedere castitas3

Et peccare nefas aut pretium est mori.

13. Fruges at Cererem, ἓν διὰ δυοῖν,
probably like ‘gemmas et lapides,’ v.
48; the double substantive is meant to
express universatim, *frutis of the ground
of every kind?

14-16. This is best illustrated by
Caesar's description (B. G. 4. 1) of the
Suevi, from whom it is possible that
Horace has transferred it to the Scy·
thians. ‘Suevi centum pagos habere
dicuntur, ex quibus quotannis singula
milia armatorum bellandi causa ex fini-
bus educunt. Reliqui qni domi manse-
· rint se atque illos alunt. Hi rursus
invicem anno post in armis sunt, illi
domi remanent. Sic neque agricultura
nec ratio atque usus belli intermittitur.
Sed privati ac separati agri apud eos
nihil est; neque longius anno remanere
uno in loco incolendi causa licet?

14. neo cultura placet, etc„ seems
therefore possibly to include the two
ideas that no individual was employed
iu tillage for more than a year together,
and that the same piece oi ground was
not tilled ior more than a year. ‘Noue
cares to till the soil for more than a
single year, and when one has sulfilled
his toil a successor relieves him ou the
same terms os service!

16. aequati sorte, sc. for a year’s
tum.

vicarius, as Cicero calls Murena, the
consul elect, ‘vicariurn diligentiae
meae,’ Mur. 37.

17, 18. ‘ Holds her hands from harm-
ing her motherless step-children! For
the use of ‘temperat' cp. Cic. Verr.
3. 59 ‘Te putet quisquam sociis tem·
perasse’? Ritter takes it, aiter the
Senot, as=‘pocula temperat,' ‘inno-

cens’ implying that she mines no poison
in the cup. There is no authority sor
the absolute use of ⁶ temperare' in this
sense.

19. dotata, on the strength of her
dower. Plaut. Meu. 5. 2. 16 ‘ ita istaec
solent quae viros subservire sibi postu·
lant dote fretae feroces.⁵ ld. Aulul.
3. 5. 61 ‘Nam quae indotata est ea in
potestate est viri; dotatae mactant et
malo et damno viros.³ tt is constr. with
‘regit' but norwith ‘fidit’ ; cp. 2. 5. r 3,
3. 25· 14.

regit, fidit, the point is the inversion
of lawful relations.

21. ‘The ample dower they bring is
their parents’ worth,’ the pure blood
and healthy traditions of virtuous house-
holds. Contrast 3. 6.17 foll.

22. metuens alterius viri3 thegen.
as ‘rixarum metuens,' 3. 19. 16, q. v.

23. certo foedare; 1. 3, 18 ‘irrupta
copula? lt is one oi Horace’s abl.
absol. (see on a. t. 12), neither exactly
the abl. of the ground of the action with
‘metuens' nor the abl. of the quality
with ‘castitas’z it adds a circumstance
which completes and explains both sub·
stantive and participle, ‘the marriage
bond was inviolable': ‘foedus’ of the
covenant of marriage3 cp. Virg. Aen. 4.
339 ‘neque haec in foedera veni'

24. ‘They dare not sin, or ir they sin
they die‚’ Conington. For the constr.
oi ‘nefas..aut’cp. 3. 12.1, a. A few
MSS. read ‘pretium mori,⁵ one ‘pre-
tium emori! 11 this were adopted we
might still take it as above. Bentley,
aud after him several editors, make
‘nefas' etc. a continuation oi the ‘ dos:
τὸ ἀθέμιτον εἶναι, van. ‘the lact that
