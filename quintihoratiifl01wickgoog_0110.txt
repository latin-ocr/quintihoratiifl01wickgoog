ODE XXVI.

‘Tne Muse's friend, 1 can cast sorrow and fears to the winds. The politics of
Par lna ttha rouble all he world are no long to rne Help me, sweet Mose, to
weave a ehaplet of freshest tlyric verse lor my dear friend Lamia.

It 1s difficolt tto see the point tof connect ion bet ttween the first arsd last tpartst of the
Ode, unlesS, indeed, as has been suggested Horace rs holding up hrs own eheerfulness
and its source to Lamia’'s imitation, see Int rodt to Od. 3. ι7.1 11 Epp. ι. 14. 6 roser
to the same person aethe two Odes, the trait there given, ‘rapto de fratre dolentis
insolabiliter‚’ may confirm the idea that he was a person on whom sorrow sat
heavily.

Aelius Lamia, the school friend ο1 Numida (Od. 1. 56. 7) and the ‘vetusto no-
bilis ab Lamo’ os 3. 17. 1, is generally identified with L. Aelius Lamia who was
Praefectus urbi in Αι). 32, and died nn. 33. Tac. Ann. 6. 27 ‘genus illi decorum,
vinda senectus! If this Ode therefore is to be dated b ore ac. 23, he must have
been quite a young man when it was written. Rider, feeling this to be a difficulty,
suggests that the Lamia of the Odes is an elder brother of Lucius. The name of
a Q. Aelius Lamia,‘triumvir1nonetalis‚’ has been found on a coin of this date.
He thinks that it is his death that Lucius is represented as lamenting in Epp. 1.
14. 6.

On the date of the Ode and the allusion of vv. 3-5 see lutrod. to Odes i-iii, 98.

With vv. 1-6 cp. Virg. G. 2. 490-497. T he friendship of the Muses gives to
Horace the freedom which Virgil attributes to philosophy and a country life.
