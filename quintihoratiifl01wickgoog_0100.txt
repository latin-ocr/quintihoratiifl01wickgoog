LIB. I. OD. 21.

ODE XXI.

Contrane Catuli. 34 ‘Dianae sumus iu fide: etc.

Several occasions have been imagiued lor tlris Ode. The Pseudo-Aer. associated
it with the Ludi Seculares. ac. 17. and it was accordingly treated 'by several
editors as an introduction to the Carm. Sec. -

Franke assigns it to ac. 28, the year in which Augustus dedicatedthe'temple to

Apollo on the Palatina(0d.1.31)‚ and instituted the quinquennial Ludi Actiaci
in honour ol Apollo and Diana. He thinks the ode was written ior their first
celebration.

Orelli considers it a mere exercise ol fancy, suggested perhaps by some such
occasion as the games of ac. 28, but not of sufficient weight to have been com-
poscd sor public performance.
