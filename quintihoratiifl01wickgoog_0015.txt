xiv INTRODUCTION.

we have numerous quotations, chiefly in the grammatical authors

of the first five centuries. These are rarely of any very high value; Ἴ

partly because quotations seem often to be made from memory, partly
because the quotation is most commonly made for some metrical
or' grammatica] reason which is not affected by the special word
or form in respect of which the doubt exists, and therefore the testi-
mony to the reading is not in tmth older than the MSS. (not usually
very ancient) of the grammaticali author himself.

So far, then, as externa] testimony goeS, it is clear that when a dis-
puted reading occurs, the evidence to which we can appeal to determine
it contains in every department some elements of uncertainty, and is not
likely to be rated at the same relative value by all critice. Can the MSS.
be made, by any process of comparison, to testify‚ through common
readings, to sources of evidence older than themselves, older even than
the Scholia? Has the value of any special MS. been unduly esti-
mated? Ι Is a particular Scholium genuine, or is it an interpolation
to suit a late MS. reading? There will romain these and other
previous questions upon which perfect agreement cannot always be
obtained 3 and, in default of such agreement, an editor or a render

who approaches questions of text on this side, confessedly with only .

second-hand knowledge, can hardly form his judgments too modestly.
It must not be supposed, however, that the criticism of Horace's text,
any more than the criticism of other classical textS, turns by any
means entirely upon the testimony of MSS. or Scholia. However
far these carry us back, they leave ua, ou the one hand, with the
certainty that varieties of reading existed, and that emendation on
grammatical or other grounds had been at work, still earlier; and,
on the other hand, they leave, if not very many blots which modern
criticism has unanimously recognised and corrected, yet enough of
these1 to make us feel that when the question lies between an τ’ or an
e, an e or an a, one or other expausion of an ambiguous abbreviation,
and the like, MS. testimony cannot be held to settle it absolutely,
without any appeal to grammar or sense. We must add that in the
majority of really doubtful readings no theory with respect to the
