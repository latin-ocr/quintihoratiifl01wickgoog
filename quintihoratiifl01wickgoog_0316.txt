LIB. IV. OD. 5. ’ 283

Quis Parthum paueat, quis gelidum Scythen, 25
Quis Germania quos horrida parturit
Fetus, incolumi Caesare? quis ferae
Bellum curet Hiberiae?
Condit quisque diem collibus insuia,
Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores ;
Hinc ad vina redit laetus et alteris
Te mensis adhibet deum;
Te multa prece, te prosequitur mero
Defuso pateris et Laribus tuum
Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris
Et magni memor Herculis
Longas o utinam, dux bone, ferias
Praestes Hesperiae! dicimus integro
Sicci mane die, dicimus nitidi,
Cum Sol Oceano subest. 40
