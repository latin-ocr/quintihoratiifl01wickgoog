ro INTRODUCTION TO THE ODES.

simplicity and light-heartednesS, stands at the end of a long Book as

well as immediately aster the high-pirched Ode on Cleopatra.
instances where we may see certainly the love of variety, very

possibly an undertone of irony, are the position of ‘Quum tu Lydia

Telephi‚' after r. ra, and that of ‘ Quid fles, Asteriei’ after the stately
Odes that begin Book iii. The mere desire to change the key is well
exempllfied in 1. 24, 25 and 3. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

4. lf 1. 38 has a fitness at the end ol 2 Book, we may note a
similar fitness lor their place in 2. 20 and 3. 1. The adaptation
indeed ol these two Odes to their position was doubtless what sug-
gested the now abandoned theory of a separate publication ol Books
i, ii, aud Book iii. That theory can really derive no support from
them, lor it would necessitate, as we have seen, an entire rearrange-
ment ol the Odes in a chronological order, in the course of which all
evidence would disappear of the position of these two Odes as well as
of all the othere.

5. The hand ol a conscious arranger must surely he scen in the fact
that Odes 1-9 of Book i comnia, with three exceptione, oue ol
which is made good in the rrth Ode, representatives ol all the metres
employed in the Three Books. We may compare with this the
obviously metrical disposition ol the Bpodes 1-10, 11-16, 17, and the

regular alternation of Alcaics and Sapphics through more than hall
of Book ii of the Odes.

6. Where definite contrasts are not required, we may see from time
to time in the selection the working of the opposite principle ol
association‚ sometimes in ageneral similarity of subject as between
2. 13, 14 3 3. 9-12 ε sometimes in some accidental phrase or thought
which seems to recall another poem to the arranger, and gulde
his hand to it, as in r. 27, where Cyrus' tipsy brawls seem to
suggest the Ode which follows on the moderate use ol wine; r. 34,
where the mention ol Fortune, even though in a different sense or
point of view, is a link to the following Ode to Fortuna Antias ; 3. 17,
where the invitation to keep holiday‚ with which the Ode endS, sug·
gests the special holiday picture of the Faunalia in 3. 18.
