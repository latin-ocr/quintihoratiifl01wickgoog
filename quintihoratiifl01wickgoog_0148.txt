ODE II.

‘Waaara has no value save to use well: used as Proculeius used it, it wius
immortal fame. To tame the spirit of avarice is more than to 'own the world.
Avarico is like the thirst of dropsy, which grows by indulgence. Virtue calls him
alone happy, him alone the true king, who has subdued the love of money?

That the Ode is addressed to Salustius is enough to show that there could be
no danger of the world’s applying its doctrine to him.

The little we know oi him is chiefly derived from Tacitus, Arm. 3. 30, where
his death in ab. ao is recorded: ‘Crispum equestri loco, C· Salustius rerum
Romanarum florentissimus auctor, sororis nepotem, in nomen adscivit. Atque ille
quanquam prompto ad capessendos honores aditu, Maecenatem aemulatae, sine
dignitate senatoria multos triumphalium consulariumque potentia anteiit, diversus a
' veterum instituto per cultum et munditias copiaque et affluentia luxu propior.
Suberat tamen vigor animi negotiis par, eo acrior quo somhum et inertiam magis
ostentabat. Igitur incolumi Maecenate proximus, mox praecipuus cui secreta
imperatorum inniterentur, et interficiendi Postumi Agrippae conscius, aetate pro·
vecta speciem magis in amicitia principis quam vim tenuit.¹ Horace had satirised
him some years before (Sat. r. 2. 48 foll), but he has now made his acquaintance in
the Court circle. Pliny (N. H. 54. a) mentions that the Sallust family possessed
copper mines in the Tarentaise <‘Centronum tractu’), and it has been suggested
that this gave a special point to the first staura, ‘As you know from your expe·
rience os ore!

’ NULLUS argento color est avaris
Abdito terris, inimice lamnae
Crispe Salusti‚ nisi temperato

Splendeat usu.

only acquires its valae by the uses it is
put to.' In the first line and a half we
have the allegory, its application helped
by the epithet ‘avaris’ which suggests
the miser's hoards as the parallel lor the
useless ore; in the remainder of the
stanza we have the application‚ but still
clothed, with the exception ol ⁶ temper·

the allegory (⁶ lamnae,¹ ‘splendeat').

lamnae, the unwrought bar into
which the ore was first run. Bentley
pointed out that the construction is
‘inimice lamnae nisi splendeat,‘ not as
it had been strangely taken, ‘nullus
argento color est nisi splendeat! For
the syncopated form see on Od. 1. 56. 8.

sion of the family and the gentile name
cp. 'Hirpine Quinti,' Od. 2. 11. 23

cellius Aulus,’ A. P. 371. Such viola-
tions ot the old usage were growing
common. Thus Velleius Paterculus
(born ac. 19) has ‘Drusus Claudius'

Much of the force of the stanza is lost if and ‘Silvanus Plautius' (2. 97 and 112,
