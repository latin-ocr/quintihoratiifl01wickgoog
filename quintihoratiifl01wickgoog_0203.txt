HORATII CARMINUM

Delenit usus nec Falerna
Vitis Achaemeniumque costum,
Cur invidendis postibus et novo
Sublime ritu moliar atrium?
Cur valle permutem Sabina
Divitias operosiores?

43. usne, lilre other expressions of
the Ode, seems to be due to Virg, G. 2.
466 ‘Nec casia liquidi corrumpitur
usus olivi’ Conington (in loc.) points
out that the two constructione are not
exactly parallel, The ‘wearing of pur·
ple' is the subject of ⁶ delenit’ in sense
as well as grammar; but the hypallage
which makes ‘ sidere clarior ’ agree with
‘usus’ rather than with ‘purpurarum’
(cp. 3. ar. 19 ‘iratos regum apices‚' and
Epod. 10. 12 and 14), is the sante as
that by which Virgil attributes to the
‘usus olivi' the adulteration which hap-
pened to the oil itsels.

44. Achaemenium, Persian. See
on 2. 12. 21.

45. inridendis, 2. 10. 7 ‘caret invi·
denda Sobrius aula.⁹

novo ritu, ⁴ aiter the modern fashion.'
Cp. Od. a. 15. 10-20,2. 18. 1-5. The
‘atrium’ was the reception room of a
great house (cp. Epp. 1. 5. 31 ‘Atria
servantem postico falle clientem ’)‚ aad
the chief care was spent on its adorn-
ment; so that the ideas os the two
lines will be exactly parallel to Virg.
G. 2. 461*463 ‘Sinon ingentem foribus
domus alta superbis Mane salutantum
totis vomit aedibus undam, Nec varios
inhiant pulchra testudine postes!

47. permutem, for construction see
on 1’. 17. a ‘Lucretilem mutat Ly·
caeo.
