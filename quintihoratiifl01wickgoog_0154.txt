LIB. II. OD. 4. ,⁴ 111

And possibly the Ode refers to some real person, although the name be fictitious.
The irony would be wasted on a shadow3 and there is a definiteness both in the
name of the ‘Phocian’ Xanthias and in the introduction oi Horace's own person-
ality (stanza 6), which is more dramatis than is usual in the purely imaginary
Odes. 11 is undoubtedly Horace's way 10 adda local designation to fictitious
characters: ‘Cnidius Gyges,' Od. 1. 5. 203 ‘Liparaei nitor Hebrl‚' 3. 12. 6. Iu
some cases, as in ‘Thurini Calais filius Ornyti‚’ 3. 9.·14, the appearance 01 com·
plete identification is strongly in point, and in all the object probably was to give
a greater semblence 01 reality. The purpose here is the less easy to' imagine, from
the lact that the name is addressed 10 Xanthias himself, not used by way 01 iden-
tifying him to others. li the lover 01 the Ode was a real persuadere may of
course be some play in the name, 01 which the point is lost to us. 'Orelli suggests
that ‘Xanthias' may be chosen 10 cover a Roman ‘Flavius' cp. Od. 3. 15.11,
where he thinks ‘Nothus’ may represent a real ‘Spurius’ Ritter imagines a
Greek resident in Rome, and, comparing Od. 1. 27. 10 ⁴ Megillae irater Opuntiae,’
ingeniously suggests that the person there rallied is none other than XanthiaS, and
that the ‘Phyllis’ 01 this Ode is the ‘Charybdis' of that; see introd. to 1. 27.

'Ihe composition of the Ode is fixed by v, 14101110 end of Horace's sortieth
