Africanus Minor, in s. c. 135. Numan-

First Punic War, stand for Roman wars

2. durum, so the great majority of
MSS. Bentley compares Virg. G. 3.4
‘Eurysthea durum‚¹ ancl points out that
there is a Horatiae antithesis between
it and the ‘molles citharae modi! Orelli
follows earlier editors in altering it on
very slight MS. authority to ‘dirum'

Siculum mere. This name, which
is generally'given to the sea to the east of
Sicily, is used by Horace of de sea
between its north coast and Italy3 see
3. 4. 28 ‘Sicula Palinurus unda.¹ Tlre
chief victories referred to will be those
of C. Duilius in ac. 260 off Mylae, on
the north coast near Messina, and of L.
Lutatius Catulus in 242 off the Aegates
Irlrsulae, at the western extremity of the

5. nimium mero, ‘ overcharged with
wine! Cp. ‘fiducia nimius? Sall. Fr.;
‘rebus secundis nimii? Tac. Hist. 4. 2 3.
Cp. Od. 1. 18. 8 ‘Centaurea . . curn Lapi-
this rixa super mero Debellata.’ Virgil
names Hylaeus the Centaur ‘Lapithis

Jupiter and the giants see Od. 3. 4. So
Me ‘fulgens contremuit' has point as
expressing the greatness, magnificence
os the interests threatened.

9. tuque pedestribus. This gives
a second reason why Horace should not
attempt the theme. It would not suit his
‘ iocosa lyra,’ and Maecenas will treat it
better in prose. F or ‘que’ in such a
case see on 1. 27. 16. Notice the ern-
phatic position of the words which irn-
ply the double opposition between
Horace and Maecenas, lyric poetry
and prose. Orelli remarks that Horace
is the first of extant Latin writers to
translate the Greek πεζός (Arist. Fr. 713,
Plat. Soph. p. 237 A πεζῇ τε eat κατὰ
μέτρον).

minacium, so V; and most oi
the good MSS. have either this or,
what is only a 'miswritiug of it, ‘mina-
tium.' From this probably arose the
corruption found in a lew, ‘minantium'
Bentley suggests as a parallel for that
reading, Ov. Trist. 4. 2. 21 foll. ‘Vin-
claque captiva reges cervice gerentes
Ante coronatos ire videbit equos: Et
cernet vultus aliis pro tempore versos,
Terribiles aliis immemoresque sui’; but
he prefers the vulg. himself, and quotes
Od. 2. 7. 11, where ‘minaces’ is used in

contremuit, with accusative, as Virg. just the same contrast; ‘that just now
