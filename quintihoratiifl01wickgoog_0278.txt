Teque nec laevus vetet ire picus
Nec vaga cornix,

Sed videa, quanto trepidet tumultu

Pronus Orion. Ego quid sit ater

Hadriae novi sinus et quid albus
Peccct Iapyx.

Hostium uxores puerique caecos

Sentiant motus orientis Austri et 7 Ἴ

Aequoris nigri fremitum et trementes
Verbere ripas, ,

Sic et Europe niveum doloso Ἴ

Credidit tauro latus et scatentem

beluis pontum mediasque fraudes
Palluit audax.

Nuper in pratis studiosa florum et

Debitae Nymphis opifex cefronae

Nocte sublustri nihil astra praeter
Vidit et undas.

15. laevus picus3 see Conington on
Virg. G. 9. 15. He points out that the
appearance on the left or on the right of

not the gcodness 01 badness of the

20. Iapyx (1. 3. 4) is the favourable
¹wind for crossing from Brundisium. It
is usually ‘albus’ (see on 1. 7. 15), but

’ capable of occasionally deceiving those

who trust it. For the verbal antithesis

et. Bent ey would read ‘at,' but ‘et’
is preferable,¹ even apart from the MSS.
The parallel (⁶ sic et Europe ’) consiste
in the confidence before the danger was
seen, followed by terror when it became
apparent. The contrast between ‘these
two is evident enough, without an ad-
versative particle to emphasize it: it is
their union in oue person which is 111
