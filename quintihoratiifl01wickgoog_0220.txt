‘Jova's thunder proves him the soverelgn oi the sky. Augustus shall prove
himself a god upon earth hy adding te the empire pritain and the hatelul
Parthians-—O shame te think of the disgrace not yet wiped away l--Roman
soldiers living as captives, sorgetful ol name and country, and country’s gods.
This was the danger that Regulus soresaw if prisoners were allowed to hope for
ransom-“Lot them die‚'' he said, “and pity them not. 1 have seen with my
own eyes the sight ol shame: Roman standards nailed up in Punic temples with
armour that was taken not irum the dead but frona the living :-Roman citizens
with their hands bound behind their beaks-Carthage peaceful and busy :urhe
work of our war audone. wilt you buy those soldiers back again? It will be a
waste of money. The deer caught in the net does not light again is you loose it,
nor does the man who has once feared death make a soldier again. He does not
know what war means.'' He put aside his wisa and children, and hung his head
as one disgraced, till the senate listened to his advice; then he went back to tor·
ture and death with as lighta heart as if he were going lor a holiday!

Another phase of Augustus’ rule. He is to retrieve the deeply·felt disgraee of
Charrae, and to restore the healthy military spirit of ancient Rome. We have in
the story of Regulus at once a measure of the disgrace to be retrieved,—-‘ It is the
very disgrace which he feared and loretold and went back to the tortura in order
to prevent,’—-anda picture os the true Roman spirit which is to be reawakened.

The whole sentiment ol the speech may be compared with Liy. aa. 59.61.

The story ot' Regulus’ mission to Rome is not [nundin Polybius, a sactwhich
has been held to throw doubt on its truth. It is summarized in the Epitome of
Liv. 18. With Cicero it isa commonplace. It is told at length in the De Off. 5.
27, a passage of which Horace recalls several turns of thought and expression.
⁴M. Attilius Regulus, cum consul iterum in Africa ex insidiis captus esset, duce
Xanthippo Lacedaemonio, imperatore autern patre Hannibalis Hamilcare, iuratus
missus est ad senatum ut nisi redditi essent Poenis captivi nobiles quidam rediret
ipse Karthaginem. Is cum Romam venisset utilitatis speciem videbat; sedeam,
ut res declarat, falsam iudicavit: quae erat talis; manere in patria, esse dorni suae
curn uxore, curn liberis; quam calamitatem accepisset in bello, communem for·
tunae bellicae iudicantem, tenere consularis dignitatis gradum. Quis negat haec
esse utilia? Quem censes? Magnitudo animi et fortitudo negat. Num locuple·
