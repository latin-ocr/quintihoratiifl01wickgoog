LIB. IV. ODssra.

303*

the Ode was written near the same time as the last, in the parallel expressions ‘Ut
tamen noris quibus advoceris Gaudiis,' 11. 13, ‘Ad quae si properas gaudia,’ 1221.
The use of ‘gaudia’ is sufficiently unusual to be notieeable‚ and to¹ occur to a
writer's mind a second time, but less likely to have been repeated at a distance of
time. ‘The Scholiasts and inscriptions of MSS. call Virgilius ‘unguentarius’
‘mercaton’ ‘negotiaton’ ‘medicus Neronum’ All look as if they were inferences
mereor less clumsy from words of the Ode itself 3 but the general impression, in
spite of the temptation to identify him with the only well-known Virgilius, that he
wasa different and later person, is of some value. Ι

The substance of the Ode is very parallel to one of Catullus (13), in which he
bids Fabullus come to supper, and bring with him all the materials save the
unguent, which he will supply himself, and which he promises shall be so delicious
that Fabullus will wish that he were all nose.
