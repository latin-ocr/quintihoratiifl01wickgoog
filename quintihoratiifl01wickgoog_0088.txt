ODE XVI.

‘an daughter oi a mother fair, though not so fair as you, burn and iorget my
scurrilous iambics. Passionis as resistless as the afflatus of Cybele, or Apollo,
or Bacchus. We are all liable to it, we all have our share oi' the liou's beart.
Tou may read its erfecrs in all story. Curb yourpassion3 Itoo was led astray
byit. Forgive me, accept my palinode and be my friend! ’ ’

‘Tyndaridi satisfacit . . Imitatus est Stesichorum poetam Siculum qui vitupera-
tionem Helenae scribens coecatus est et postea responso Apollinis laudem eius
scripsit et oculorum aspectum recepit, cuius rei et in Epodo poeta idem

meminit :-
‘Infamis Helenae Castor offensus vice

Fraterque magni Castoris victi prece
Adempta vati reddidere lumina! Acron.

‘Hac ode παλινῳδίαν repromittit ei in quarn probrosum yarmen scripserat Tyn·
doridi amicae suae! Porph.

ln accordance with this the Ode is headed in the MSS. B and A ‘ad Tyn·
dariden.'

‘Cantat palinodiam, i. e. cantando revocat quae scripserat iratus in amicam
Gratidiam,’ Comnr. Crnq. And so some MSS. head it ‘Palinodia Gratidiam*
Others unite the two views, and identify ‘Tyndaris' with ‘Gratidio’ or ‘ Canidia’ ;
‘Palinodia Gratidiae vel Tyndaridis!

For the first view, which identifies the unknown object oi this palinode with the
Tyndaris of the following Ode, there seems to be no external argument. There
f was the temptation to connect the two Odes, to make the invitation oi that the
complement os the reconciliation iu this; and the connection ol the name of Helen
on the one side with the name of Tyndaris, and on the other with the original
‘ palinode‚’ would easily suggestio ingenious Scholiasts the desired tink.

With respect to the second view the case is not so clear. Ti the ‘criminosi
iambi' here recanted are to be looked for among Horace’s extant poems‚ they can
hardly be other than his attacks on Canidia in Epodes 5 aud 17„ To our ideas it
is a slight recantation for such a libel, so much so that ir might seem io force us to
give both to the Epodes and to Sat. 1. 8 less reality than we should naturally give.
There is no bitterness in this Ode, nothing which would justify us in holding (for
this is one suggestion) that it is acontinuation of the libel, the ‘tu pudica, tu proba'
which he offered to sing, ‘mendaci lyra,’ ‘ tuning his harp to salsehood,' in Epod.
17. 39. ς but yet the tone of the palinode is barely serious. There isa mock heroic
air iu the ‘urbes altae,' ‘Thyestes' ‘Prometheus' (comp. Od. 2. 4, 4. 11. 2 5 foll,
and Epod, 3). Itis intended, as Newrnan says, to make the occasion slightly
ridiculous‚ to represent both himself and the lady as having made too much of it.

The παλινῳδία of Stesichorus, which added to the legend of Troy the famous
variation that it was only a phantom in Helen's shape that Paris carried from
Mycenae, is mentioned by Plato, Phaedr. ²43 A, who quotes the first three

lines :-
orla ἐστ’ ἔτυμον λόγος οὗτος
οὐδ’ ἔβας ἓν νηυσὶν εὐσέλμων
οὐδ’ ἵκεο Πὲργαμα Tpoias,
