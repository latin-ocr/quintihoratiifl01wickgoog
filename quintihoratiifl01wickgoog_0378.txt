crasa. aron. 5·

Diris agam vos3 dira detestatio
Nulla expiatur victima.

Quin, ubi perire iussus exspiravero,
Nocturnus occurram Furor

Petamque voltus umbra curvis unguibus,
Quaevis deornm est manium,

Et inquietis assidens praecordiis
Pavore somnos auferam. v

Vos turba vicatim hinc et hinc saxis petens
Contundet obscoenas anus ;'

Post insepulta membra different lupi
Et Esquilinae alites3

Neque hoc parentes heu mihi superstites
Effugerit spectaculum.

tror' ε ‘ that he, etc„ will be sent as envoy,
not Ι.’ Munro would amend this ver·
sion ol the lines by separating ‘magnum’
from ‘sas nefasque? and making it=‘ id
quod maguum est,’ ‘sorceries such is
their power, can overset,’ etc. Of other
interpretations¹ the best seem to be
those which explain ‘humanam vicem'
by Sallust's ‘pecorum vicem obtrunca-
bantur‚' Cicero's ‘Sardanapali vicem
tucri,³ ad An. ro. 8, ‘aster the lashion ol
mens ἀνθρώπων δίκην. It would still be
a question whether ‘venena' was the
object of ‘ convertere’ or the subject ol
‘valent’ ln the first case it = ‘veneficae'
as ‘ scelns’ is used for a wicked person;
there isan obvious point in refusing
them a more persona] appellation, when
the statement is that they have no human
hearts to bemoved. Theline os thought
then is, ‘ Conscience cannot move you,

my curses may at least punish you.’ If '

we take it in the second way it will
mean, ·The mighty laws ol right and
wrong‘are not like human things, that
sorceries should have power to overset
them. Yon may kill me, but Ι shall be
revenged on you yet!

Neither MSS. nor Scholia give any
ariations of the text, and none of the
conjectures are attractiva. Rentley (who
offers it very hesitatingly) proposes ‘ma-
gica' ‘non vertere,' Haupt ‘maga non,’
Keller ‘ humana invicem!

89. diris, ‘cursen' as in the passage
ol Tacitus quoted on v. 85.

diro detestatio, the solemn denun-
ciation ol a curse.

92. Furor seems to be used as a mas-
culineformolFuria. For the idea oi the ,
passage cp. Virg. Aen. 4. 385.

94. deorum manium, the spirits of
tlte dead; literally‚ according to Curtius,
Grundz. p. 294, the ‘good' powers,
‘manis ’ being the opposite of ‘immanis'
Cp. Cic. de Leg. a. 9 ‘Deorum manium
iura sancta sunto. Hos leto datos divos
habento!

100. Esquilinae, the birds of carrion
that hannted the slopes of the Esquiline,
still the ‘miserae plebis commuue sepul-
chrum: Sat. 1. 8.10. For the hiatus,
the diphthong being shortened, op. Sat.
1. 9. 38 ‘Si me amas inquit,’ aud such
iustanees in Virgil as Aen. 5. 211 ‘Insu-
lae ionio: etc.
