mention of the fickleness and treachery of Menas, hns been thought to fix the date
os the Epode, if it refers tu him, to the period between his first desertion of Sextus
Pompeius and his return to his service iu 36. Yet during that time he was serving
with the iicet which he had carried over to Octavianus' side; and, though he may
have visited Rome, he can hardly have become as familiar a sight to the Roman
populace as is implied by vv. 11-16. The office of ‘tribunus miiitu1n¹ seems also
a strange one to be selected (Horace would choose the highest that he filled) sor the
commander os a lieet. Several MSS, including B and A, head the Epode with the
words‘Ad Sextum Menam libertinum. Vedium Rufum ex servitute miratur usur·
passe equestrem dignitatem usquead tribunatum militum: with no sign that the
two inscriptions are inconsistent oralteruative; a common mistake, which seems to
lead us back to some common authority ot greater antiquity. Ol the two names
offered, Menas was a likely guess to any one' who lmew the history of the time, and
therefore carries with it less probability than the entirely unknown name of Vedius
Rufus, to which there was nothing in the text or in the generally known histories
to lead a copyist or annotator. Orelli shows from an inscription that Rufus is
lound among the cognomina of the Vedii.
