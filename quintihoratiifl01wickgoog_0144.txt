LIBER SECUNDUS.

ODE I.

‘Ponnro is writing the tale of the civil warS, a difficult and delicate task. We
can afiord to let even his tragedies wait awhile, till the great aid braye orator os
the forum and the senate, and the conqueror of Illyria, has given us his history.
In our engerness wc seem already to hear the trumpets and see the flashing armour,
to hear nnn reading to us of the fall oi chiestains and the conquest of all the world
save Cato's stubborn soul. Ay, Jugurtha is avenged now! What land or sea is
not red with the blood of our fratricidal warsi But stay, my Muse, these are no
themesforyou.’ ,

There is nothing to fix very definitely the date of the Ode. The expressions oi
the two first stamas ‘nondum expiatis? ‘cineri dolosos perhaps attraet it lo the
Odes (such as 1. a and 14) which dwell more on the trodbles from which the State
had already escaped, than on the new and peacesul order on which it had entered.
Augustus is not mentioned. Pollio had not sided with him, and had certainly been
a friend oi M. Antony. But the Ode expresses, as strongly as Od. 1. a, that weari-
ness os bloodshed which had induced men to acquiesce in the rule os one.

C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and supportet oi Julius Caesar, having passed
through the Consulship in ac. 40 (Virg. E. 4), and won the honours of a triumph
ior his campaign against the illyrians (ib. 8. 6-13),withdrew from public life, and,
in the subsequent struggle between Antony and Octavius, remained honourably
neutral. He was a magnificent patron oi literature, and is famous as having estabss
lished the first public library at Ro'r‘ne out os the spoils os his lllyrian campaign.
He was also one oi the most accomplished men of the age. Catullus (12. 9) speaks
of hirn in his youth as ‘leporum Disertus puer et facetiarum? He is ranked among
the great orators by Quintilian (ro. 1. 113), Seneca (Epist. 100), and Tacitus (De Or.
58). His tragedies are spoken ofin high terms by Virgil (E. 8. ro ‘sola Sophocleo
tua carmina digna cothunro’) and Horace (Sat. 1. ro. 4²)· His history oi the
civil wara ironr Bc. 60 to the establishrnent of Augustus' power, isreierred to by
Tacitus (Anu. 4. 34), Suetonius (Jul. Caes. 50). ' '

We may notice the skill with which Pollio's various accomplishments are worked
incidentally into the Ode.
