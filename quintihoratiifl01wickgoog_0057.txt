HORATII CARMINUM

Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
Ventorumque regat pater
Obstrictis aliis praeter Iapyga,
Navis, quae tibi creditum
Debes Virgilium, finibus Atticis
Reddas incolumem, precor,
Et serves animae dimidium meae.
Illi robur'et aes triplex
Circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci 10

Od. 1. 5. 15 ‘potenti maris deo': 1. 6.
10 ‘musa lyrae potens! He is address-
ing Venus (⁶ marina,' Od. 3. 26. 5, 4. 11.
15) 3 she was worshipped at Cnidus
under the name ol εὐσλσία, Paus. 1.1. 4.
Cp. Ov. Her. 19. 160 ‘Auso Venus ipsa
favebit, Sternet et aequoreas aequore
nata vias’

2. fratres Helenae, ‘Castor and
Pollux,' Od. 4. 8. 51 ‘Clarum Tyndari·
dae sidus ab infimis Quassas eripiunt
aequoribus rates’ Cp. r. 12. ²5 loll,
5. 29. 64. They were especial protec-
tors of sailors, who saw their presence
in ibe electris lights which are said to
play about the spars ol a vessel at times
after stormy weather in the Mediterra-
nean, and which are now called St.
Elmo’s fire. lt is these, and not the
constellation Gemini, that are the ‘lu-
cida sidera' Cp. Statius Pro. Met. Cel.
8 ‘Prolerte benigna Sidera, et antennae
gemino considite comu’

3. regat, sor the number, see on v.
10.

pater, ‘Aeolus’ lrorn Hom. Od. 10.
213 cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 52.

4. aliie, ‘all others,' cp· Sat. 1. ro.
77‚an uncommon use, but found even in
good prose; ‘vulgus aliud trucidatum,'
Liv.7,19. lt is perhaps rather in its
sense of ἀλλοῖος than of ἄλλος, ‘those of
other kinds.'

Iapyga, ‘albus Iapyx? Od. 3. 27. 20.
The NW. wind, which got its name in
the mouths of those who crossed lrom
Brundusium to Dyrrhachium, on whom
it blew from the ⁶ I'apygium Promonto-
rium' in Apulia, and to whom it was
the most favourable wind.

6. finibus Attidis, ‘ambiguum ut-
rum “debes finibus Atticis'’ an ‘⁴ finibus

‘Atticis reddas,'¹' Porph. It is really
governed ἀπὸ καινοῦ, as grammarians
say, by both. This is a construction
which Horace osten adopts lor the sake

os brevity, and to avoid clumsy and
unmanageable pronouns and particles. ·
Compare the position of ‘consiliis' in
Od. 2.11.11; ol ‘sibi' in 3. 8.19; of
‘cantare' in Sat. 1. 3. a. The metaphor
of a 'depositum' (Stat. l. c. 5 ‘Grande
tuo rarumque damus, Neptune, pro-
sundo Depositum') is sustained through
the words ‘ creditum,’ ‘debes’ ‘reddas';
with ‘incolumem’ the ‘salety' ol Virgil
becomes again more prominent than
the ‘entireness’ of the repayment.

8. et, 'and so.’ It couples two de·
scriptions ol the same action, first in its
relation to Virgil, then in its relation to
Horace, cp. 2. a. ro,4.13.10.

animae dimidium, ‘secundum illam
amicitiae definitionem φιλία ἐστὶ μία
ψυχὴ ἐν δυοῖν aduectus Porph.; Call.
Ep. 43 ἥμισύ μευ ψυχῆς ἔτι τὸ πνέον,
ἥμισυ δ’ ote οἶδ’ εἴτ’ 'Epor εἴτ’ Ἀΐδης
ἥρπασε, πλὴν ἀφανές. Cp. Od. 2. 17. 5
‘te meae partem animae?

9. robur et aes triplex. The ori-
ginal ol this and other expressions ol
the kind is the Homeric σιδήρεον θυμόν,
Il. 21. 357; σιδήρειαν ἧπαρ, 24. 205.
Jani took the words as=‘robur aeris
triplicis,' quoting Virg. Aen. 7. 609
‘aeternaque robora ferri' But the ac-
cumulation ‘oak and triple brass' is
like Aesch. P. V. 242 σιδηρόφρων τε κάκ
πέτρας εἴργασμένσεε cp. Od. 5. 16. 2
‘turris aenea Robustaeque sores* lt is
common both in Greek and Latin to
put the two things conjunctively, rather
than as alternatives; cp. Hector’s wish
for Paris, Il. 3. 40 εἷθ’ ὄφελες ἄγονός
τ’ ἔμεναι ἄγαμόε τ’ ἀπολέσθαι. See on
Od. 3. 11. 49.

10. erat. It is common in Horace
to find a singular verb with two or three
subjects where all, or the one nearest
to the verb, are singular. Bentley gives
alist on Od. 1. 24. 8 ‘Cui Pudor et
Iustitiae soror Incorrupta Fides nudaque
