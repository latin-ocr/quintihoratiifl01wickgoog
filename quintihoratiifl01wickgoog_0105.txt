HORATII CARMINUM

oue >curu Ν

‘You fly lronr rne, Chloe, like a srightened kid to its darn. I am not a tiger or
lion 'going to eat you. You are too old lor such shyness¹

We have possibly part of a Greek original to this Ode in a fragment of
Anacreon (Fr. 51 Bergk) :-

dyurdrs οἶά τε νεβρὸν νεοθηλέα
'ycrluatlryvdv‘dur'¹ ἐν ὕλης κεροέσσης
austriacas ὑπὸ μητρὸς ἐπτοήθη.

Chloe's name seems to be chosen to suit the character, see Introd. to i. 8 and

A . 1.
pp Metre-Fistlr Asclepiad.

VITAS hinnuleo rne similis, Chloe,
Quaerenti pavidam montibus aviis
. Matrem nou sine vano

¹ Aurarum et siliiae metu.
‹Nam seu mobilibus veris inhorruit ᾗ
Adventus foliis seu virides rubum

Dimovere lacertae, ᾗ

Et corde et genibus tremit.

· ⁵ 1. vitas. This was the reading of the light-hung leaves hath run the shiver
the Comm. Cruq. and is found in one of spring's approach,¹i.e. of the ‘animae

MS, of the ioth century (rr); but if it
be right, it was very early corrupted to
‘vitat,’ which is read in B and all the
other roth century MSS, was interpreted
by Porph. and Aen, and is quoted by
Diomedes A change from the third
person in v. 1 to the second in v.9
would be strange in the absence of any
change of tone to account for it; and,
on the other hand, a misunderstanding
ol the suhj. of ⁶ tremit’ may have led a
copyist to assimilata ‘vitas' to it. On
the metrical question, see on Od. 1. 15.
24, and Index ol Matres.

4. aurarum et siluae, cp. Virg. Aen.
a. 728 ‘Nunc omnes terrent aurae sonus
excitat omnis! ‘Siliiae' is a trisyll. as
in Epod.13.2; so ‘miluus’ Epod. 16.
3²·

5. veris . , adventusetc, ‘if through

veris comites? Od. 4. 12. 1; Lucret. 5.
755 ‘It ver et Venus et Veneris prae·
nuntius ante Pinnatus graditur Zephyrus!
Bentley, pressing‘ adventus’ too closely,
objects that when spring is still ap·
proaching there are no leaves nor
lizards nor sawns. and is displeased at
the boldness of attributing the shiver to
the approach ol spring rather than to
the leaves, see 4, 4, 7. Muretus had
written (⁶ ex codd' but no extant MS. is
known to have it) ‘Vitis inhorruit Ad
ventum,' which Bentley accepted, alter·
ing ‘vitis' to ‘vepris' a conj. which had
occurred independently to Salmasius
The Vulg. was read by the scholiasts.

7. lacertae, Virg. E. a. 9 ‘Nunc
virides etiam occultant spineta lacer·
toa.

8. tremit, sc. hinnuleua
