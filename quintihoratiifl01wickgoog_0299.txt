O DE ΙΙ.Η

'As vain for any of us to imitate Pindar as to soar on wings of Icarusr Pindar
rolls down strong and deep, as a river in duod, supreme alike in dithyrambs, hynnns,
ἐπινίκια, θρῆνοι. He soars on the urinds, the swan of song; 1 ily from flower to
flower, like the bee of my native Apulia, and roam from wood to wood gathering
my little store of poetic honey. Sorne day, Antonius, when Caesar comes home,
some greater poet such as you must sing his triumph-Caesar, the best and
greatest gift which heaven ever gave to earth, even in the golden age, our joy at
receiving him back, our gemes, our holiday. Even 1 may lind a voice then amid
the happy multitude. We will all shout and rey'oice and offer incense; you will
oller a lordly sacrifice, as belits you, 1 a home-bred call'

, Julus Antonius was the son of the Triumvir by Fulvia, and was educated by his
step-mother Octavia. Through her protection he was spared when his brother
Marcus Antyllus was stain. and rose eventually to high favour with Augustus, and
was married to Marcella, Octavia's daughter, aster her divorce from Agrippa in
ac. 21. Horace’s Ode is the only ancient authority for his having been a poet;
but the Pseudo-Acron vouches for his having written an excellent Epic poem in
twelve Douka, called the Diomedem, some years afterwards. He was made praetor
ina.c.13‚and consul in rac. ro. In ac. 2 he was condemned to death on the
charge of adulterans intercourse with Julia.

On the bearing of the Ode see Introd. p. 258. lt does not follow, of course,
that the Ode was written after the later Odea It may well be, as Franke thinks,
that the omission of any reference to the successes of Tiberius and Drusus makes it
improbable that it was written aster the year 15.

With the form of the Ode, refusing praise in word, yet granting itin the act of
refusal both directly and indirectly‚ comp. 1. 6, arrd r. 12.
