Ι1222722 no ivory couches nor gilded ceiling nor rare marbles nor palace nor
crowd of retainers. 1102 Ι have honour and wit and the respect 02212020 richer
than 20720122221 Ι arn contented. You lay house to house as 12 you were to live for
ever. The land is not large enough, you mustbuild in thesea. Nay, you must

, pluck up your neighbour's landrnark and drive out your own client to misery.

Yet more surely than any house you are building the grave awaits you. Think 02
that limit-the grave, where you and your poor neighbours‚ oppressor and op-
pressed‚ are on an equality.’ ¹

Horace opposes two pictores: one, ol himself, contented and happy with his sarm
and his poetry; 2120 021202, 02 some rich marr so suh 02 712222 202 building and in·
creasing his property as to sorget death and 20 commit wrong and robbery. Ode
15 complained of the great growth 02 2120 villas of 2120 wealthy on 2120 ground 02
the waste 02 ground which was wanted lor agriculture. ..This Ode touches on
anot ther evil incident 21 202 this 722210οΛ 2120 uojust and cruel ejection 02 2222211 owners

usual satire 022 2120 20117 02 leaving death out 02 our calculatione. Death 12 not
only more certain thanl all our plens-he is the great equalizer and redresser 02

With the picture 02 2120 72227107 7207210202 compare Sallust's expressions where
heis tracing that alienatiou 02 classes which led to the civil wars‚ Jug. 41 ‘populus
militia atque inopia urgebatur; praedas bellicas imperatores curu¹ paucis diripie-
bant; interea parentes aut parvi liberi militurn ut quisque potentiori confinis erat
sedibus pellebantur?

Bacchylides 2·-
