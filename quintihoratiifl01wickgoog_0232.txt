ODE VIII.

Tus Ode is written sor an expected or imagiued visit 01 Maecenas 011 the first
anniversary 01 the poete narrow escape srom the falling trce (a. 13, a. 17. 27, 3. 4,
27). The festival of March 1 was the Matronalia. Maecenas is supposed 011 his
eutry to wonder what 001 be the reason that a bachelor's horne'shows preparation
sor sacrifice on such a day. The answer is, that the poet is paying a vow to Bac-
chus, which he had made at the time of his miraculous preservation. ‘The best
wine is to be brought out,’ and so the Ode pasees into 01 invitation to Maecenas
to enter into the spirit 01 the time-to iorget the troubles of State. ‘All is going
well; the Dacians are checked‚ the Parthians quarrelling among themselves, even
the Cantabrian subdued at last, and the Scythians unstn'nging theIr bowst Mac·
cenas may enjoy a little privacy and Inununity from care!
