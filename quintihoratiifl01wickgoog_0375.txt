HORATII EPODON

Non defuisse masculae libidinis
Ariminensem Foliam

‘Et otiosa credidit Neapolis
Et omne vicinum oppidum,

Quae sidera excantata voce Thessala
Lunamque caelo deripit.

Hic irresectum saeva dente livido
Canidia rodens pollicem

Quid dixit aut quid tacuit? O rebus meis
Non infideles amittae,

Nox et Diana, quae silentium regiS,
Arcana cum fiunt sacra,

Nunc, nunc adeste, nunc in hostiles domos
Iram atque numen vertite!

Formidolosis dum latent silvis ferae 55
Dulci sopore languidae,

41. non defuisse, ‘was not wanting
to her part⁷; see argument. The men-
tion of F olia of Ariminum (a town of
Umbria 011 the Adriatic), apparently a
real person, and the appeal to the gossip
of Naples‚ are intended to give an air oi
truthlulness to the story.

43. otiosa,a town of Greeks and sea·
side loungers, who sis οὐδὲν ἕτερον εὐ-
καίρουνῆ λέγειν τι καὶ ἀκούειν καινότεροντ
cp. Liv. 8. 22 ‘gentem lingua magis
strenuam quarn factis! The Comm.
Cruq. says that Naples was also called
‘fabulosa' ‘gossiping.' ¹

45. sidera exeantata; Epod. 17. 5
and 78, Virg. E. 8. 69.

47. irreseetum, ‘grown long’r Sat.
1. 8. 26 ‘scalpere terram Unguibus! It
is another attribute ol the Furies; see
on v.15, and cp. v. 93.

dente livido, ‘blank from age,’ to
add to the repulsiveuess of the picture;

or like ‘ dente invido,’ Od. 4. 3.16, the ,

passion of jealousy being attributed to
the tooth. The action isintended to
express her excitement as she awaits
impatientIy the issue oi her spells.

49. quid dixit aut summouit, a
proverbial way oi expressing want of
restraint in speaking, whether, as here,
from passion, or as in Epp. 1. 7. 72
‘dicenda tacenda locutus‚' irom garru-
lity; cp. ῥητὰ ἄρρητά τε.

50. Cp. Medea's invocation Ov. Met.
7, 19² toll. ‘Nux ait, arcanis fidissima. .

Tuque triceps Hecate quae coeptis con-
scia nostris Adiutrixqueveuis¹ Theocr.
a. 10. ra.

arbitrare, in=Cicero’s sense of ‘wit-
nesses,' Off. 3. 31.

53. in hostiles domos, perhaps only
the common formula sor ‘avert from my
home'; cp. Od. 1. 21. 15 ‘in Persas

..atque Britannos,' 3. ²7· 21. If special

‘eremias' mrrst be found, they will be
her rivals in the love of Varus

55. formidolosis. The MSS. vary
between this reading and the nominative
‘formidolosae’ B, A, and the Queen's
Coll. MS. have the ablativa. Bentley
interprete theevidenceas tonore fairly
than Keller. Cruquius found, it appears.
the ablative in all the Bland. Mss, aod
with it the annotation ‘propter horrorem
noctis et ierarum’; but inasmuch as
there was also the contradictory anno-
tation which he prints in the Scholia,
‘timendae, quod timorem incutiant,’ he
did not think it worth while, io a matter

esset ¹), and where the evidence oi his
authorities was thus divides, to alter the
received text. If we read the ablativa,
it will have an active meaning, as Virg.
G. 4. 468 ‘caligantem nigra sonnidine
silvam! This is Horace’s use of the
adjective in Od.2.17. 18. It we have
the nominative, it will have a passive
sense, ‘rimorousl as in Ter. Eun. 4. 6.
18, etc. In either case its force seems
