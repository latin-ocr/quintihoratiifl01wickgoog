LIB. IV. OD. 6. ·

Dardanas turres ¹quateret tremenda
Cuspide pugnax.

Ille, mordaci velut icta fero

Pinus aut impulsa cupressus Eure,

Procidit late posuitque collum in
Pulvere Teucro. ,

Troas et laetam Priami choreis

Falleret aulam;
Sed palam captis gravis heu nefas! heul
Nescios fari pueros Achivis
Ureret flammis etiam latentem

7. Dardanas. For the torm see on
1.1 .ro.

8.5 cuspide, his famous spear ;,Hom.
Il. 19. 387 'Ea δ’ ἄρα σύριγγος πατρώϊον
ἐσπάσατ’ ἔγχος Βριθὺ μέγα στιβαρόν· τὸ
μὲν οὔ διἰιοτ’ ἄλλοι Ἀχαιῶν Πάλλειν,
aaa. The ablative can hardly be inde-
pendent either oi ⁶ quateret' or of ‘ pug-
nax,’ ‘made the towers of Troy quake
before the repeated onset os his terrible
spear.’

9-13. ille . ‚illa supply the vam of
any more definite contrast, by logical
coniunctiore, ol the two picturas, of what
was anri what might haur been it Apollo
had not intersered.

9, ιο. ‘As a pine cleft by the axe, οι·
a cypress blown down by the east wind.’
Perhaps the double simile is meant to
touch two stages in the same action : ‘so
Achilles was strichen down. and so he
fert! Cp. the double simile at the be-
ginning ol 4. 4.

mordaci, eating into the wood at
every stroke.

Achilles’ death, in Hom. Od. 24. 39 σὺ

13· Minervae saera mentito, ‘that
seigned Minerva's worship'; Virg. Aen.

14. mala feriatos, ‘keeping iil-timed
holiday’; Virg. Aen. a. 248, 9. Eur.
Troad. 515 soll.

of the substitution even in rhetorical
prose. Cp. Virg. Aen. 5. 325, 6. 293,
‘he was not one to surprise? etc.

17. 'palam captis gravis. His foe·
rnen would have been taken in open
day, in iair agan but when. taken they
must not have looked ior quarter. Per-
haps the position of ‘palam’ where it
answers to the keynote ot the last
staura, ‘mentito . falleret: is meant to
enable it in thought to quality both
‘captis' and ‘gravis’ ‘He was open
throughout; he resorted to no stratagem,
and he affected no clemency.’ Some
MSS. leavea gap in the place of ‘ captis';
a few have ‘vict0r,' one ‘raptos’ and
‘captos’is found as av. l. in one MS. ol
Horace, andin the Med. MS. of Acron's
Comm. a diversity of testimony, which
seems to Bentley, Orelli, Dilis, to show
that all are alike conjecturat restorations
oi a word lost in early copies, Corn-
pare a similar case in Epp. a. 2. 199.
‘Captis rs read by the Reme and by
Cruquius

heu nefas! baut Compare the sigh
in ‘Heu pervicacis ad pedes Achillei:

19. latentem. The singular, which
Lambinus and Cruquius had altered,
is very likely due, as bentley pointed
out, to Hom. Il. 6. 58, Horace hav·
