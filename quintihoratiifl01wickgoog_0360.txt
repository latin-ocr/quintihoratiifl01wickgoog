HORATII EPODON LIBER. s

...--——--

EPODE 1.,

‘Yon Maecenas, are going to expose yourself to all the dangers 01 war for
Caesar's sake-what think you 1 shall do, 10 whom you are as much as Caesar

can beto you? Ishall follow you to the world's end. Do you ask what good ’

10000101 Ishall be in less terror if Iam with you than iilam absent. Ihave
noselfisb motive. Your bounty has made me rich enough already. Idon'twant
more either to hoard or to squander.'

This Epode is usually referred (after the 15011011οε1) to the spring 01 rac. 31, when
Augustus, according to Dio (50. 11), before setting out to Actium, summoned the
chief men 01 Rome, senators and equites, to meet him at Brundisium ι τοὺς μὲν ὅπως
τι συμπράξωσιν αὐτῷ, τοὺς δ’ deors μηδὲν μονωθέντεε νεοχμώσωσι, τό τε μέγιστον ὅπως
ἐνδείξηται τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ὅτι καὶ τὸ πλεῖστον καὶ τὸ κράτιστον τῶν Ῥωμαίων ὃμογνω·
porcio ἔχοι. 11 would be probable that Maecenas would gowitb the rest, although
he must have returned 10 Rome and not gone on 10 Actium, as Dio (51. 3) speaks
01 his having been lest in charge 01 Rome and Italy during the campaign.
Mr. Dyer, however (in the Classical Museum, vol. ii. p. ao foll„ and in the D ct.
Biog. s. v. Maecenas), argues strongly for the view that the Epode belongs 10 the
war against Sextus Pompeius in the year nc. 36, when there is reason (Appiam de
Bell. Civ. 5. p. 729) to believe that Maecenas was in Sicily with Octavianus. He
thinks that Horace actually accompanied him as he proposes to do, and that the
otherwise unidentified escape from shipwrcck in the poet’s life (⁴ Sicula Palinurus
unda,’ Od. 3. 4. 28 q. v.) belongs to this expedition.
