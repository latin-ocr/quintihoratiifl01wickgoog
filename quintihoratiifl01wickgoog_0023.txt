personal acquaintance with Roman life, from the fact that they
bear evidence of having been composed by men who had in their
hands early authorities which are otherwise lost to us. These are
sometimes referred to by name, as Terentius Scaurus (a grammarian
of Hadrian's time who wrote a commentary on the Ars Poetica) on
Sat. a. 5. 923 Claranus (lilartial. ro. 21. 2, Seneca, Ep. 66) on Sat.
2. 3. 833 more often generally as ‘nonnulli,’ ‘alii,’ ‘plerique' ‘com-
mentator' (Aer. on A. P. rao), ‘qui de personis Horatianis scripse·
runt' (Porph. on Sat. 1. 3. 21 and 91, a. 5. 92).

O. Keller,l who has collected and used with much ingenuity all the
avallable evidence on the subject, gives the palm of antiquity to the
Scholia of Porphyrion. The only limit set to their date by external

ἵ testimony is to be found in the mention of Porphyrion's name by
Charisius,a grammatical writer, usually placed about no. 400; but
Keller thinks they are as early as roo-250 nu. The evidence on
which he relies consiste wholly of indications in the Scholia them·
selues, such as (a) the writer's personal knowledge of Rome coupled
with the fact that he never alludes to the walls of Aurelian (au. 271),
while he recognizes the older gates, as eg the Porta Esquilina on
Epod5. 100,Sal.,1. 8. 13 (b) his use of Parthi, Parthicus, ete. as
designations of the great eastern monarchy, in several places where
the Pseudo-Acron uses Persae, Persicus, a natural variation if the fall
of Parthia and the rise of the Persian dynasty of the Sassanidae
(6.6. 666) had taken place between the two dates ; (c) his way of
speaking of the religious ceremonies of heathen Rome as though they
were still observed in his own time. Contrast, eg. his note on Od.
3. 11. 6 ‘fidicines hodieque Rornae sacrificiis adhiberi videmus' with
Acron's ‘et in sacrificiis fidicines adhiberi consueverant‚’ or that on
Od. a. 16. 14 ‘salinum patella iu qua primitiae dis curn sale dantur'
with Acron's ‘patella in qua dis primitiae offerebantur: or lastly, that
on 3. 5. 11 ‘Aeternam Vestam, propter aeternos ignes quiin aracius
coluntur' with Acron's ‘ aeterni ignis quiin ara eius indefesse colebatur?

The genuine Acron wrote earlier than Porphyrion, if the latter’s
quotation of him on Sat. 1. 8. 25 is not an interpolation, ‘memini
me legere apud Helenium Aaronem Saganam fuisse libertum Pom-
ponii senatoris qui atriumviris est proscriptus? Itis to be remarked,
however, that the statement thus quoted does not occur in the Scholia
which go under Acron's name. On the other hand, we lind in them,
the change of tense already noticed with respect to sacrifices ete,
