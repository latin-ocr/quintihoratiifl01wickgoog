we are on less 2212 ground. A very few can be fixed with exactness.
Sachare 1. 31, which is written for the dedication 21 the temple of
, Apollo Palatinus in ac. 283 2. 4, which Horace dates himself in
rac. 25, by reference to his own age ; 1. 24 and 3. 14, both of which
are tired to nc. 24, the one by the known date of the death of Quin·
tilius, the other by the return of Augustus from Spain. We may
perhaps add 2 few, though in their case of course more latitude must
be given, which speak in terms of near anticipation of political events
which can themselves be dated. Such are r. 35, which represents
Augustus as on the point 21 starting for Britain, a purpose for which
we know that he set out from Rome in uc. 27 (see lntrod. to that
Ode, Dio 53. 22, 25) ; and 1. 29, which seems to refer to prepara·
tions more or less immediately preceding Aelius Gallus’ expedition
into Arabia Felix in 22. 24. Such again are the Odes (2. 15 and 3.
6) in which we can hardly doubt the reference to the restoration of
temples which Augustus undertook in the year aas ’

§ 4. Those who would go much beyond this in fixing with accuracy
the date of single Odes have to lean a good deal on Horace’s references
to events on the frontier and beyond it, movements of the Cantabrian,
the Scythiam the Parthian. In estimating the value oi these it is of
course necessary to be sure of the nature 21 the allusion. We are in
danger of confusing poetry with history when we look too closely into
every mention of Dacian or Indian and search the pages of Dio or
Strabo for some detail that will exactly suit it. Horace’s verses are
soll of the feeling of the greatness of the Roman empire,.the remote-
ness of its frontiers, the immense charge which Caesar has taken on
himself. And the names of distant and unknown places and tribes
had a spell in ancient times which they have lost in days of maps and
geography. Even when we come to more definite references as
those to the quarrels 21 Phraates and Tiridates or to the frequent
risings of the Cantabri, though we have here ample ground for dating
generally the period during the course 21 which the poems must have
been composed‚ and exactly, if we know the date 21 2 special event
referred tn, the year before which the particular poem could not have
been composed‚ we yet soon get to the point where the event has
become 2 standing illustration 21 the vicissitudes of fortune or 2
statesman's auxieties,a poetical commonplace which may recur till it
is supplanted by some fresh circumstance which strikes the poet’s
imagination.

To this it must be added that the foreign history of the time is
