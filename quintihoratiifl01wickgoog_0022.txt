defects must actually have existed: it becomes a question of less or
more. But the antecedent probability ol the suppositions which are
necessary to any theory of the interpolation of spurious Odes or parts
of Odes cannot be so easily granted. Every known fact in the history
of Horace’s poems can be explained without such a theory, unless
indeed it be assumed that no poem or stanza which falls below his
highest poetical level can be genuine. On the other hand, as
ΜΓ. Munro points out¹‚ in his vigorous summary of the arguments
against the interpolation theory, the form of Horaceb poenis is
specially his own. We are asked to imagine that unknown poetS,
in the literary age of Rome, reproduced it with a skill and complete-
ness of which the known poets who have tried to imitate it proved
themselves incapable. The editors who have done tbe most for the
interpretation oi Horace in this generation (Orelli, Dillenburger, „
Ritter) are the least disposed to allow of any spurio-us poeuis or
passages in his text. But though Peerlkamp's ynethod of criticism
must be pronounced baselesS, we may trace from it, as from its pre-
* decessor, indirect results oi value in the attention which it calls to the
sequence ol thought, the lights and shades ol style, and the varying
merit of the poetry.

II. Tae Scholiasta.

Tira collections of Scholia on Horace which pass under the names
of Helenius Acron, and Pomponius Porphyrion, can neither of thern
be certainly dated, and some doubt therefore hangs over their relation
to one another 3 neither of them is in a perfect state nor free from
suspicion of interpolations. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, they
must be considered ol very high value. On questions of text the
authority of the commentary is at the least several centurias older than
any MS. ol the poet, either extant or known to us by testimony. Ol
course the ‘lemmata' or quoted words. to which the comment is
affixed, are ol inferior importance, and they differ not unfrequently
from the teat interpreted in the commentary, and can only by them-
selves carry us back to the date oi the oldest MS. oi the Scholia, viz.
at the earliest to centuries 9-10. On questions ol interpretation, and
especially of allusions to customs, sites and persons, the Scholia have
valne, independently of any doubt as to their writer's precise date or
