ODE XXVIII.

Ir 11 be essential to good drama that 1111 (1111111110 play should be at least so
obvious that most intelligent readers should put the same Interpretation upon it,
this Ode cannot be pronounced very successful. Its scene, its nature, the division
01 the parts (if it is a dialogice), its purpose, are all points on which it would be
hard to find two editors who agree. ,

The question oi the scene has been complicated by doubts which have been
raised as to the locality 01 the ‘Matinum litus' The Scholiasts speak with an
uncertain volce. ‘Mons Apuliae, slve ut quidam volunt plana Calabriae' is
Acron’s note. Porph. calls it here ‘promontorium Apuliae'; on Epod. 16. 28
‘mons Calabriae.’ Ritter, arguing from this Ode, and pressing the identity 01 the
‘Matina apis’ 01 od. 4. 2. 27 with the ‘Calabrae apes' 01 3. 16. 33, aud the Taren-
tine bees of 2. 6. 14, places it near Tarentum, where it was natural that Archytas
should have been buried. The balance of evidence, however,¹ 11 greatly' 111 favour
of the more northernt site. The‘ Matina cacumina ol Epod 16. 28 would seem
to have been part tos he range 0 Mount Garganus and the lrtus Ma rnurn ’the
shore at their base. Avillage aad port at tthis place rs still called‘ Martinata!
Lucan, 9. 182, jolns Vultur, Garganus, and ‘calidi buxeta Matini,' as all belonging
to Apulia. The Scholiasts' confusion arose more probably from the ragueness
with which the term ‘Calabria’ was employed in many writers. We must choose
then 101 the sceneos the Ode between the ‘litus Matinum,' as thus explained, and
