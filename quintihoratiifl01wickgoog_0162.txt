LIB. 11.

OD. 7.

Fregi coronatus nitentes
Malobathro Syrio capillos,
Tecum Philippos et celerem fugam
Sensi relicta non bene parmula,
Cum fracta virtus et minaces
Turpe solum tetigere mento
Sed me per hostes Mercurius celer ·
Denso paventem sustulit aere 3
Te rursus in bellum resorbens
Unda iretis tulit aestuosis.

This can hardly have been during the
actual campaign in Macedonia, but it is
probable that Horace, while in Brutus’
army, was in Asia; see Milman’s Life
oi Horace, p. 17, anri on Sat. 1. 7, and
Epp. 1. 11. 6.

10. non bene; there is the same
irony in the dimin. ‘parmula' ‘mypoor
little shield’; cp. Epod. 1. 16 ‘Imbellis
ac firmus parum,' and contrast Epp. 1.
ιο. 23 ‘Me primis urbis belli placuisse
domique! T hat Horace should have
been able playiully to impule cowardice
to himself is enough, as Lessing pointed
out, to prove that he had no sear that
others would impute it to him. He is
clearly thinking, as his Roman readers
would have thought, of Alcaeus at
Sigeum, Herod. 5. 053 see the lines of
Alcaeus (Fr. aa Bergk) conjecturally
restored from Strabo 13· p. 600 κᾶρυξ

11. oum fracta virtus. Oi his own
share in the campaign the poet professes
to remember only the stolen holidays
of carousing, the dropped shield and
ssight3 but this gives greater soree to
the few words in which he speaks oi
the fall oi the cause for which he
fought. He seems to say, ‘What could
1 do when Valour itself broke, and

those who threatened so high bit the
dust in defeat¹l Horace heartily em-
braced Octavius'cause, and put his
muse at his patron's service, but he was
not expected to reyile the party he had
leit, ep. 1. 12. 35. Orelli suggests that
there is a reminiscence of Brutus’ last
words,⁷ss τλῆμον ἀρετή, napos ἄρ’ ἧσθ’,
ἐγὼ δέ σε ‘ils ἔργον ἤσκουν, Dio C. 47.

ιο. turpe, defeat is felt as disgrace,
Od. 3. a. 17 ‘repulsae sordidae? From
another point oi view the poet may say
‘dulce et decorum est,’ but here he is
only speaking of the contrast between
the hopes and the event.

tetigere mento, probably the Ho-
meric πρηνέες ἔν κονίῃσιν ὀδὰξ λαζοίατο
γαῖαν, Il. 2. 418, etc. Orelli, however,
takes it oi suppliants throwing them-
selves at the conqueror's feet.

13. sed me, opp. ‘tecum' v. 9.
The ‘sed’ contrasts the separation of
Horace’s lot hom that· oi Pompeius
in this stanza with their union in the
last. ' ’

Mercurius, the poet is a ‘Mercurialis
vir,' a. 17. 29. Mercury carries him
saiely through the soe as he led Priam
through the camp oi Troy’s enemie5,‘1.
10. 1-3 loll. Horace is thinking oi the
escape of Paris, 11. 3. 380, of Aeneas, 5.

15. resorbens unda, the wave has
thrown Horace high and dry, its down·
draught carries back Pompeius into the
deep water. See a similar image in
Epp. 2. a. 47 ‘Civilisque rudem belli
tulit aestus in arma.⁹

16. fretis aestuosis seems to be one
oi Horace's ablatives absolute, see on
a. 1. 12, ‘in that boiling surf.’
