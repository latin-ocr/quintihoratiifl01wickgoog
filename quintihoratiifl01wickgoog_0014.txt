GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

THE TEXT, MSS„ SCHOLIASTS, EDITIONS.

Au editor whose knowledge of MSS. is dlmost entirely at
second-hand owes some apology, at least to himself, for dis-
cussing questions of text 3 but he can hardly avoid suchqdiscussion.
Even if he chooses an existing text ashis guide throughout, he
must by his choice virtually take a side in many intricate questions,
and he does so in the way which is the least instructive to bis reader,
by appearing ,to settle without discussion questions which are really
open. Happily the text of Horace is one in which, if some points
must always remain in uncertainty‚ the uncertainty is of avery bear-
able kind. The worst result of a bad judgment will usually be only
to prefer the least probable of two readings either of which has much
to say for itself‚ makes good sense, and has been supported by great
scholars.

It will be seen that the MSS. of Horace, though very numerous,
are not very ancient. There are none, like the uncial MSS. of Virgil‚
of palmary authority. There are a considerable number which are
placed between the end of the 9th and roth centurics3 only one now
extant which belongs undoubtedly to the 9th. ln addition to these,

we have the testimony of Cruquius (see below), at. whatever value
it is to be rated‚ to the readings of a MS. probably some two
centuries earlier, and we have Scholia which are generally believed to
date, at least in their original form, from the 3rd to the 5th century.
Occasionally, where doubt hangs over the form of some salient
expression in Horace, we find light thrown upon it by more or less
certain imitations of it in Ovid, or in the later Roman poets. Lastly‚
