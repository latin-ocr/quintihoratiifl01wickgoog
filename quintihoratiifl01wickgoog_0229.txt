HORATII CARMINUM

oDE llll.

‘Don'r weep, Asterie, ‘sor your absent Gyges. (He will come bach to yon with
the spring and bring =a wealth of Bithynian merchandize. He will come back:
he is only detained by the winter in the harbour to which he was driven on his
way home. He lies awalce at night thinking of you. It is all in vain that his
hostess Chlo'e‘ tries every art to win him, sends emissaries to tell him of her
passion and to prove to him from mythology the folly of constancy; he turns
a deas ear to it all. Only mind you do as well. Your neighbour Enipeus is a
brave young gallant, but 'don't open your window if he comes to serenade you.’

As Orelli characterizes it, ιεἷδύλλιοιι mercatorum vitam amoresque lyrice descri-
bens' The names are Greek, the lise Roman. ·Ritter points out the effect of this
Ode in relieving by its lightness and grace theseriousness os the preceding six.
Compare the position os Od. 1.,38.
