To these Keller and Holder add a Paris MS, (7975) of the 11th
century, to which they both attribute high value ( ).

of the roth century also is the hlS. in Queen's College, Onfo'rd, a
collation of which is given at the end of this volume (Reg).

It has been already suggested, that the only method by which cou-
clusive evidence upon questions of disputed reading could be gathered
srorn MSS. of such late date, would be by grouping them in families
or ‘recensione' each family being made by its common readings to
bear witness to some archetype of much greater antiquity than the copies
which we now possess, This has been attempted by Keller, and
with more completeness by Holder1. A and a, λ and ἰ,.φ and ψ, as
we have seen, have been supposed to be severally related in this way,
and the readings of their imagined archetypes are indicated by Holder
by the signs A', λ’, F. With his fuller ‘apparatus criticus’ on the

Satires and Epistles, the process is carried still further, and the result .

is, to the extent that uniform readings can be obtained, a certain
number of conjecturally restored MSS. of the yth and 8th centuries.
These and the other solitary representatives of older MSS. are again
grouped into three classes,

The frrst of these is distinguished as containing, with many faults of
carelessness and with a certain number of grammatical corrections
