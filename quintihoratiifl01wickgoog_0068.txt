LIB. I.

OD. 7.

Et praeceps Anio ac Tiburni lucus et uda
Mobilibus pomaria rivis.
Albus ut obscuro deterget nubila caelo ¹⁵
Saepe Notus neque parturit imbres ,
Perpetuo, sic tu sapiens finire memento
Tristitiam vitaeque labores
Molli, Plance, mero, seu tc fulgentia signis q
Castra tenent seu densa tenebit ἦ 20
Tiburis umbra tui. Teucer Salamina patremque
Cum fugeret, tamen uda Lyaeo
Tempora populea fertur vinxisse corona,
Sic tristes affatus amicos:
Quo nos cunque feret melior fortuna parente, 25
Ibimus, 0 socii comitesque.
Nil desperandum Teucro duce et auspice Teucr0;

to some sulphureous springs near Lau·
rentum.

13. Tiburni, acc. to Virg. Aen. 7.
672, Tiburnus (Virg. calls him ‘Tibur-
tus'), Catillus (‘Catilus,‘ Hor. Od. 1.
18. a), and Coras were three Argive
brothers, founders of Tibur.

14. mobilibus rivis. Bum, 1. c. ‘A
third portion of the Anio is diverted
just above the bridge into canals appa·
rently of very ancient date. which, pass·
ing completely through the ceutre of the
town, are used as the motive power of
watermills of every kind and then fall
ttttllltll?ltrltrtdtdtrrt
. points ol the romantic cliffs on the
western hill side’

15. albus, predicative. The south
wind is sometimes hsvrduoroa not al-
ways ‘niger Auster! The lesson is that
the very same wind which brings the
clouds will presently clear them. ‘Al-
bus' as ‘albus Iapyx‚' Od. 3. 27. 19;
‘candidi Favonii,' 3. 7. 1.

16. parturit, see on Od. 4. 5. 26.

17. sapiens, ‘be wiso and remem-
ber,' etc, Od. 1. 11. 6 ‘sapias vina
liques.’

19. molli, ‘mellom’ as ‘lene' Od. 3.
29. a. It breaks the flow oi the sen·
· tence needlessly to take ‘molli’ with
Rura, as an imperative.

ao. tenent . .tenebit, ‘as now,' ‘as
by and bye,' stress is clearly laid on tbe
tenses, so that apparently Plancus was

now, or might be supposed to be, cam·
paigning. ,

a1loll. This story ol Teucer is not
found elsewhere, beyond the fact of his
being ill-received by his father Telamon
because he returned without Ajax, and
of his founding Salamis in Cyprus.
Cicero may possibly be referring to a
common source in Tusc. 5. 57 ‘ad om·
nem rationem Teucri vox accommodari
potest: Patria est ubicunque est bene.’

22. cum rugaret, when he was start-
ing on his banishment, not ‘during his
flight' as though he had put in to shore
lor the night, as some commentators
suppose, see on v. 32.

23. populea, sacred to Hercules, to
whom as a wanderer Teucer would
offer sacrifiee; ‘vagus Hercules! Od. 3.
3. 9. Orelli quotes Xenophon, Anab. 6.
a. 9, who speaks of sacrificing τῷ ἡγε-
μόνι Ἡρακλεῖ.

27. duce ct auspice, ‘uuderTeucer's
conduct and Teucer's star,' a curicus
technicality ol Roman military life to
put into Teucer's mouth. ‘Ductu et
auspicio,’ Liv. 6. 123 ‘domuit partim
ductu partim auspiciis suis Cantabriam·
etc.. Suet. Oct. 21. The two did not
necessarily belong to the same person.
The auspices were taken in the name
of the Imperator, and the ‘felicitas' was
his,'see Od. 4. 14. 33 foll. Horace has
not exactly reproduced the technical
phrase, for we find ‘auspiciis Camilli,
Augusti‚' etc„ not ‘auspice Camillo?
