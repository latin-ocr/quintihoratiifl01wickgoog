LIBER. EPOD. 5..

At 'expedita Sagana per totam domurn η
Spargens Avernales aquas

Horret capillis ut marinus asperis
Echinus aut currens aper.

Abacta nulla Veia conscientia
Ligonibus duris humum

Exhauriebat ingemens laboribus,
Quo posset infossus puer?

Longo die bis terque mutatae dapis

inemori spectaculo,

Cum promineret ore, quantum exstant aqua 35
Suspensa mento corpora;

Exsecta uti medulla et aridum iecur
Amoris esset poculum,

Interminato curn semel fixae cibo
intabuissent populaet 40

the teeth ola wild beast' In any case
they are appropriate to this ‘desideri
poculum‚' as typical of the rage ol dis-
appointed animal passion. Compare in
this respect the more potent speil of vv.
st·40·

²4· Colchicis = ‘magicis' such as
Medea might have kindled.

²5· expeditaae‘suecincta,’ Sat. 1. 8.
25·
26. Avernales, as the witeb in Virg.
Aen. 4. 512 ‘Sparserat et latices simula·
tos fontis Averni!

28. currens. The epithet seemed
out of place to Bentley, as the boar’s
hristles do not rise more when he is run·
ning, and he advocates Heinsins’ conjec-
ture ‘Laurens’ But ‘currens’ is in

point as completing the whole msam-¹

blance of the boar to Sagana bustling
about. It has the more place, as we
have had no definite verb to express her
movements.

²9· abacta nulia conscientia, ‘not
one whit deterred by her consciousness
oi what she was doing? i. e. of its cruelty
and wichedness. For the use of ‘nulla’
see on Od. 3. 20. 7.

30. duris, not quite an inart epithet,
if we compare Od. 3. 11. 31, 4. 4. 57.
The ‘hardness ¹ ol the iron is in away
identified with the persistence of her
purpose-she would dig till the iron was
tire .

humum, the soil in the ‘impluvium'

oflthpl house (v. 25) in which the scene
rs ar .

33. bis terque. So all the good
MSS. and editors since Bentley, against
the v. 1. ‘bis terve! He points out that
the two readings differ materially in
sense. ‘Bis terque ³ =¹ saepe,' cp. A. P.
440 ‘melius te posse negares, Bis terque
expertum frustra’; ‘bis terve’=‘raro,'
cp. A. P. 358.

34. inemori spectaculo, ἐναποθνή-
σκειν τῇ θέᾳ. ‘Inemori’ isan ἅπαξ λεγ.

56. suspenso mento explains ‘quan ι
tum exstant aqua,' ‘as much as is above
water ol a swirnnrer's body, when it
lloats as though it hung by the chin’

37. exsecta. This (or ‘erecta') is
the reading of V and Β, and ol the MSS.
of Acr. and Porph. Bentley’s objection
that we require rather an epithet to
correspond with ‘aridum' is very well
answered by Ritter. We do not require

¹ one, for ‘aridum ' is intended to cover

both substantives, as is ‘exsecta’ also;
see on Od. 2.10.6‚2.11.1,a.15.18.
20, 3. 4. 18, 4. 9. 29. The other MSS.
offer many variants: ‘exsucta’ ‘exsucca’
‘exuta’ ‘exerta' Bentley preferred a
conjecture of Heinsius, ‘exesa'

59. interminato, pass. part. oi the
usually deponent ‘interminor‚’ a stronger
word than ‘interdico’ ‘forbidden with
threats.’

semel with ‘cum,' ‘as soon as ever,'
as ‘ut semel‚' Sat. a. 1. ²4·
