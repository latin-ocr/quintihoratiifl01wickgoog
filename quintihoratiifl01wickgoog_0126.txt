LIB. l. OD. 32.

O D E XXXII.

‘Tum call on us sora song. Come, my lyre, 1 have drawn strains from thee
before which, light though they be, will not soon die: answer now with such
music ior Roman ears as thou yieldedst of old to Alcaeus. He was a patriot and a
warrior, yet amidst his wars and shipwrecks he found time to sing of wine arrd
love. Olyre, the delight oi gods, the solace ol toil¹ help me too'whenever I duly
call on thee' -

lt is not unlikely that the Ode refers to some request of Augustus or Maecenas
for a poem os a graver cast: Ritter thinks the six stately Alcaic Odes which stand
at the beginning oi Book iii. There is an appearance ol reality in the appeal
of the first stanna, and in the pains which he takes to point out that lyrics on
Lycus’ black hair were not inconsistent in Alcaeus' case with civic zeal and
soldierly courage. It is written, like Od. 1. 1, 2. 20, 5. 5ο, when Horace had
become easy as to his own powers and their recognition by the world. See,

however, on v. 1.

preted by both the Schol.‚ and so quoted
byServiusonVirg.Ecl.1.ro. Thereading
is strongly supported by the occurrence
oi the same phrase several times in Ovid.
Fast. 4. 721 ‘Palilia poscor,' 'I am
asked for a poem on the Palilia ’; Met.
5. 555 ‘Poscimur Aonides‚' 4. 274 ‘Pos-
citur Alcathoe‚’ ‘seilicet ut narret sabu-
larn‚’ Bentl. There is a rival reading
‘poscimus’ which has the authority ol
B and oi Diomedes, and which Bentl.
supports. lt seems to necessitate the
alteration, which he also adopts, in the
mode ol taking the whole stanza. He
puts ‘si quid . . tecum’ into a paren·
thesis, making ‘quod et huncio annum
vivat et plures' a description not of
what Horace and his lyre have already
sung, but of the greater song now asked
ior, ‘carmen' being constructed ἀπὸ κοι-
νοῦ with ‘poscimus’ and ‘dic’ It is
obvious that this would alter the cha·
racter of the poem. It would hardly
lead us to think ol any special occasion,
and the tone of confidence would have
ranished from it.

si quid. lusimus, the usual formula

for urging a petition. C. S. 57 ‘Roma
sl vestrum opus est‚’ etc.; Virg. Aen. 4.
517 ‘si bene quidde te merui . . oro!

vacui, in hourol leisure. S. a. 5. 10
‘si vacuum tepido cepisset villula tecto’ ;
Virg. G. 5. 3 ‘quae vacuas tenuissent
carmina mentes.’

Latinum, for it is a Greek lyre that
is called upon to give music to Roman
ears. Horace is ‘Romanae fidicen lyrae‚’
Od. 4. 5. 23. The main antithesis is
contained in the words ‘Latinum’ ‘Les-
bio‚’ helped also probably. as Dillr suga
gesta by an antithesis which might he
ielt between the Greek and Latin ‘bar-
bite‚’ ‘carmen' See on Od. 1. 1. 34.
