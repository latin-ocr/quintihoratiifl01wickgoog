HORATII CARMINUM

Merses profundo: pulchrior evenit:
Luctere: multa· proruet integrunt
Cum laude victorem geretque
Proelia coniugibus loquenda.
Karthagini iam non ego nuntios
Mittam superbos: occidit, occidit
Spes omnis et· fortuna nostri
Nominis Hasdrubale interempto
Nil Claudiae non perficiunt manus,
Quas ct benigno numine Iuppiter

particular story, ior Echion was one o'l

the five of the Sparti who survived the
mutual slaughter; Ov. Met. 3. 126.

65. mersae, ‘plunge it if you will.’
For the construction cp. Epp. 1. 10. 24.
Some good MSS. (including Bern.) have
the corruption ‘mersus' which, as Bent-
ley points out, is impossible, since ‘ gens'
must be the subject. Ritter thinks this
line and the next have a definite histor·
ical¹ reference to the disasters 01 the
Romans by sea'in the First Punic War,
and on'land in the Second, and their
subsequentrecovery in each case. With
the thoughts 01 the stauza compare the
sayings attributed to Hannibalby Livy
(27. 14), ‘cum eo nimirum hoste res est
qui nec bonamnec malam serre fortunam
potest. Seu vicit, ferociter instat victis:
seu victus est instaurat cum victoribus
certamen,’ and by Justin. 31. 6 ‘cum
Romano seu occupaveris prior aliqua
seu viceris tamen etiam cum victo et
iacente luctandum esse?

evenit, so all the good MSS. ‘ Exiet,’
which Orelli accepts from very little
MS. authority, in order to harmonise
with ‘proruet' and ‘geret’ is a lonn
oi the future unparalleled in any clas·
sical writer. There is more MS. au·
thority sor converting the other verbs
into presents; but this only shows that
the difference 01 tense was felt as a
difficulty.

66. multe oum laude, ‘amid loud
applause,' 01 aleat in awrestling match.
lt is also taken with ‘integrum' ‘ with
all his laureis?

integrum*iresh,'‘withallhispowers
unbroken.’ We have to understand
srom ‘integrum victorem,’ thar the sub·
ject 01 the sentence, on the contrary, has
just been thrown.

68. coniugibus loquenda. It is

hard to say whether this is to be taken, ¹

with Orelli, of their own wives, ‘ior
their wives to tell of,' i. e, in pride; or, ¹
with Ritter, 01 the Carthaginiens’ wives,
‘which only wives will live to tell ol,’
the husbands being all slain. The latter
gives a more definite climax 10 the
stanza; but it must be allowed that if
this is the meaning, we should have
expected some word to imply either that
the ‘wives' would be widows‚ or that
their ‘talk' would be by way 0111100111-
ing. Catullus puts the idea more dis-
tinctly. ‘Illius egregias virtutes claraque
lacta Saepe fatebuntur gnatorum in
funere matr-es,’ 64. 349.

69. iarn non . ,superbos as after
Cannae. Cp. Livy’s account 01 Mago's
mission to Carthage to announce that
victory, and carry the prool oi it in
three bushels 01 gold rings taken 110111
Roman knights,¹ 23. 12.

72. Hasdrubale interemptor Liv.
28. 12.

73-76. It is a question whether the
stanza is a continuation 01 Hannibal's
speech or the poet's summing up. The
latter seems more likely. A quiet ending
ofthe Ode is part of Horace's art (see
Introd. 10 Books 11111111), but he
would hardly put into Hannibal's mouth
a dull prophecy 01 the glories oi tlre
house 01 Nero. Ι1 is pretty certain, also,
that Ritter is right in supposing that
the ‘curae sagaces ’ belong to Angustus.
Cp. 4. 14. 16 and 32 · Te copias, te con-
silium et tuos Praebente Divos! Ho-
race's intention is to unite the praises
os the emperor with those 01 the young
Neros. Here the compliment is inten-
sified by the conjunction os his protec-
tion and that 01 Jupiter. This is the
only interpretation which will give the
last line and a half sufficient weight to
