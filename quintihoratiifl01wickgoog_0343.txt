HORATII CARMINUM

Te copias, te consilium et tuos
Praebente divos. Nam tibi, quo die
Portus Alexandrea supplex
Et vacuam patefecit aulam,
‘Fortuna lustro prospera tertio

Laudemque et optatum peractis

Imperiis decus arrogavit.

tibi quo dia, etc. The meaning is,
that this war was brought to an end just
fifteen years after Augustus' victorious
entry into Alexandria. This took place
on the Kalends of August, ac. 30.
Whether we are to press the words
‘quo die' to mean on the very same
day of the year, there is nothing to

second substantive is the vehicle sor the
qualifications ‘optatum' ‘arrogavit’
which thus obtain more force than if
they had to share the emphasis in a
,clause with the main substantive itsels.
⁶ Glory‚ even the one glory that remained
to be added to thy triumphs? That
‘imperiis’ refers to past campaigns, not
to the commands of Augustus which
