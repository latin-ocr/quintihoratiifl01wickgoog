‘rimosa Sabiueusis agri regio est ln qua Horatii ager fuit,’ Aer. The Ode
itseli certainly suggests such a locality. The poet‘seems to be at home at the
spring. The surrounding objectsare too familiar to obtrude'themselres on the
picture. The spring, now called ‘Fontana degli Oratini' on the hill-side between
the two suggested sites for Horace¹s sarm, answers well enough to the description.
It gushes out suddenly at the bottom oi a small iace oi rock, crowned now, not by
ilex, but by a lig-trec, and its rush of cold water, the crystal clearness oi the basin
which it forms, and then tho liic with which it starts tobound and prattle down
the steep slope to the valiey are quite enough to wake apoet's enthusiasm. On
the other hand, it has been shown that as lateas the ¹12th century there was a
church standing on a site which can be identified 'about six miles south of Venusia,
which is named in ecciesiastical documentsof the time as ‘Ecch SS. MM. Gervasi
et Protasi in Bandusino Fonte apud Venusiam! If this evidence bc held conclusive
we must either suppose that Horace writes frona an ali ctionate memory of the
Eandusian spring, such as he elsewhere shows of Mount Vivitur, the nestling village
oi Acherontia, and other spots near the home of his boyhood; or, ii ‘cras dona-

some period in his lile he revisited Venusia, The fact, however, that he does not

to make various guesses in early times as well as late, aud the Venusian claimant
