HORATII CARMINUM

Hic saxo, liquidis ille coloribus

Sollers nunc hominem ponere, nunc deum.

Sed non haec mihi vis, nec tibi talium

Res estant animus deliciarum egeus. ιο
Gaudes carminibus3 carmina possumus

Donare et pretium dicere muneri.

Non incisa notis marmora publicis,

Per quae spiritus et vita redit bonis

8. ponere, to ‘represent’ properly of
sculpture; to set up, to leave standing
before you. Cp. Α. P. 56 ‘Infelix operis
summae, quia ponere totum Nesciet,’
Od. 4² 1. ao 'ponet marmoream,' Virg.
E. 3. 46, and the correlative ‘stare’ Sat.
a. 3.183 ‘aeneus ut stes? It is trans-
ferred to poetical representation Jur. 1.
1. 155 ‘Pone Tigellinum!

9. haec vis, either=‘facultas,' sc.
‘donandi talia‚' but it is hard to parallel
the use, or=‘harum deliciarum copia,’
as ‘hederae vis’ 4. 11. 4.

1160 is the reading of V against the
more common ‘nom'

10. res . . animus, you are too rich
to want such daintypresents, too simple
in your tastes 10 care for them.

12. pretium dicare muneri, ie.
. tell you how much itis worth. The
construction asin Sat. 2. 3. ²3 ‘Callidus
huic signo ponebam milia centum‚¹ Ter.
Hecyra Prol. 41 ‘si nunquam avare

mainder of the Ode is' occupied in set-
ting its value on the gift’ i. 6. in setting
forth the ‘deathless powers’ that ‘to
verse belong!

by order 01 tbe State. There seems to
be au allusion 10 an act of Augustus
(Suet. Aug. 31), who had erected in his
Forum statues of the great generals of the
Republic, with laudatory inscriptions.

13-20. The general meaning of these
lines is clear, though the literature which
they have occasioned is a sufficient proof
that their expression is somewhat con·
, fused. ‘No other record of great deeds,
such as statues and inscriptions (which
may be destroyed and obliterated), not
the great deeds themselves (which may
be forgotten), can confer immortality of
fame as poetry can! The expression
begins generally as if he were going to
tall< of all great generals; the second
clause narrows it to Scipio Africanus
Major. The chief difficulty lies iu v. 17.

Attempts bave been made to explain
that verse 01 the buming of the camp 01
Syphax bytho elder Scipio, Liv. 30. 5,
or the burningof the Carthaginian ships
surrendered at the end of the Second
PunicWar,‘quarum conspectum repente
incendium [tradunt] tam lugubre fuisse
Poenis quam si tum ipsa Carthago ar-
deret,' Liv. 30. 433 and if Ennius him-
self had used such a phrase, we might
have explained it in one of these ways as
a natural exaggeration3 but, after the
actual event, the ‘buming of Carthage'
in a Rornan's mouth can hardly mean
anything but its buming by Scipio Atri-
canus Minor at the end of the Third
Punic War, in ac. 146, seventeeu years
after the death of 'the elder Scipio, and
five years after the death of his friend
the poet Ennius, who in his Annales
wrote a poetical account of the Second
Punic War. We cannot accuse Horace
of confusing the two Scipios, and (as
Bentley points outl the critical contem-
poraries who heard and read his postne,
of tolerating the confusion. Nor are
the conjectural emendations ‘impendia’
(Cunninghaml, ‘stipendia' (D‘oringl, ‘In
dispendia' (Hermannl, likely or happy.
Bentley condemns the line asa monkish
interpolation, on metrical as well as
historical grounds, auditis the first and
most obvious victim of those who wish
to reduce the Ode 10 conlormity with
Meineke’s canon: see Index of Metres,
ξ 6. lt· remains to interpret the lines as
they stand, and the difficulties do not
seem to be as great as they have been
represented. 11 we wish (with Ritter)
to rnaloe Africanus Major the subject 01
the whole comparison. then the buming
01 Cartbage will be adduced, 1101 as his
act, but as the crowu and completiou by
one 01 his name of his victories as some-
thingwbicb might be supposed to revive
and keep alive his fame. 'Not marble
monuments, not his great feats 01 arms,
1101 the completest posthumous success
