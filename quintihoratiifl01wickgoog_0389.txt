HORATII EPODON

EPODE XI.

'l aava no beart for poetry. A different passion has smitten me. Ι arn the
victim of Love in a way that uo one else is. Three years ago it was Inachia. I
was the talk of the town: my moody ways, my loud complaints thatshe preferred
money to merit, my resolutioris to free myself, and my repeated return to slavery.
Now it is another. Neither advice nor rebuffs will cure me. The only relies that

Ican look for is some new passion.¹

Horace, as Ritter remarks, turus the sting of his iambic verse. iu profession at
least, upon himself. We know no more oi his friend Pettius (or Pectius as some
MSS. spell it), to whom the Epode is addressed.

Metre-Arcftz'fochr'um Illm.

Purrr, nihil me sicut antea iuvat
Scribere versiculos amore percussum gravi,
Amore, qui me praeter omnes expetit
Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.
Hic tertius December, ex quo destiti

lnachia furere, silvis honorem decutit.
Heu me, per Urbem-nam pudet tanti mali-

Fabula quanta fui! Conviviorum et poenitet,
In quis amantem languor et silentium

Arguit et latere petitus imo spiritus
Contrane lucrum nil valere candidum

Pauperis ingenium? querebar applorans tibi,

2. versiculos, the diminutive gives a
touch ef ironical contempt, as in Sat. 1.
10. 58.

amore peramarum, probably a re-
miniscence of Lucretius, r. 9²2 ‘acri
Percussit thyrso laudis spes magna
menatem, Et simul incussit suavem mi
in pectus amorem Musarum‚' coloured
perhaps by Virgil's imitation, G. 2. 476
‘ingenti percussus amore'; so that
‘amore’ made emphatic by its repeti·
tion, and explained in v. 4 has the force
of a ‘passion vehement and irresistible,
bnt not for the Muses!

3. expectaueram the prose ‘quem
urat'

6. honorem decutit, Od.1. 17. 16
‘Ruris honorum,‘ Virg. G. 2. 404 ‘Fri-
gidus et silvis Aquilo decussit honorem’

see Conington’s note there. Servius
says that that line is horrowed from
Varro Atacinus3 if so, Horace may
have taken it from the same source.

7. nam pudet, the reason for his
exclaiming ‘heu me,' etc, not for the
fact which he states iu his exclama-
tion.

8. fabula, ‘a topic of talk‚' Epp. 1.
15. .

13. arguit. the perfect tenses

11. contrane ..valera Madv. ξ 599,
Virg. Aen. 1. 39 'Mene incepto desistere
victam,’ and so too Cicero, Rosc. Am.
14 ‘Tene tibi partes istas depoposcisse'?
It expresses surprise and indignation.

ra. applorans, ‘wailing with some
one to listen’ The word only occurs
here and once in Seneca.
