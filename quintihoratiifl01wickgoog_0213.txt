HORATH CARMINUM

ODE IV.

‘Cremona aid me in my song. ls it a delusion, oram 1 already among the
Muses, hearingand seeing them? lam theirsavourite. Ia mychildhood the wood-
pigcons covered rue with leaves when 1 was asleep on the hiliside, and through life
the Muses have given me a special protection. For their love l escaped Philippi,
and the lalling trec, and shipwreck off Palinurus And they are Caesar's solace
and relreshmenttoo. They give him gentle counsels, and he accepts them. We
all know how Jove's' boli swept away the brutal Titans; sor all their strength ol
arm, and piled mountains and upton-ted trees¹ they could not stand against Pallas
and the gods who ranged themselves mound her. Strength without mind falls of
its own weight; strength, tempered with moderation, the gods advance and pro·
tect. The giants are in Tartarus, and will never be released. Lavvless lust is
punished with endless chains'

This Ode deals with the side oi the imperial re'gimr which probably did most to
attract and hold last such adherents as Horace himself. The Muses themselves
⁴ gave gentle counsels to Caesar? It was the ragime ol moderatiori, of relinement,
ol literary culture. These who still continued to conspire against this gentle rule
were as the giants trying to overthrow the Olympian gods, and restore the dominica
of insensate force and lawless lust. But iorce without wisdom was powerless.
