HORATII CARMINUM

Descendat in Campum petitor,

Moribus hic meliorque fama
Contendat, 1111 turba clientium
Sit maior: aequa lege Necessitas

Sortitur insignes et imos;

Omne capax movet urna nomen.
Destrictus ensis cui super impla
Cervice pendet, non Siculae dapes

Dulcem elaborabunt saporem,

Non avium citharaeque cantus
Somnum reducent. Somnus agrestium
Lenis virorum non humiles domos

Fastidit umbrosamque ripam,

Non Zephyris agitata Tempe.
Desiderantem quod satis est neque
Tumultuosum sollicitat mare,

Nec saevus Arcturi cadentis

Impetus aut orientis Haedi,
