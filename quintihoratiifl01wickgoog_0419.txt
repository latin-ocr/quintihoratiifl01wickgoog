The metrc is described by Hephaestion, who takes as bis type an
Ode of Alcaeus of which the first line, which he quotes seems as if it
may have been the original of Horacc's Ode (see Introd. to Od. 3. 12).
Itis not, he sayS, as it may easily be taken to be, an unbroken succes·
sion of similar feet, but broken into periods often feet each. Bentley
pointed out that Horace¹s Ode consists of forty feet, i.e. four such
periodS, and held that the arrangement in lines which many editors
debate, was merely a necessity of the writer or printer‚ and not to be
elevated into a law of the mette.

ξ 6. Α few words may be added on what is called by some editors
‘Meinekc's canon.² He noticed that, with two exceptione, all the
Odes¹ of Horace containa number of lines which is amultiple of four.
Of these, 3. 12 has just been discusscd. It has been ananged by some
persons in stanzas of four lines (see Excurs. onitin Orelli's edition);
but it might fairly be coutendcd‚ either that the nature of the metre
consisting not of verses but of feet, exempted it from the common
category, or that, inasmuch as it consists of four periods of ten feet
each, it complies with the same conditione as other Odes. The other
exception is Od. 4. 8, which contains thirty-four verses. It so ¹
happens that this Ode already lay under some suspicion, on account
of the historical difficulty of v. 17 ². On this facts Meineke laid
down the general law that all the Odes conformed to the type of the
Alcaic, Sapphic, and third, fourth, and fifth Asclepiad metreS, and
were to bc broken into four-line stanzas. Od. 4. 8 was to be rectified

¹Tbe law is not applied to the Epodes, , ² Bentley had complained of the same
