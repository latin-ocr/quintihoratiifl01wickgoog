HORATII CARMINUM

Adduxere sitim tempora, Virgili ς
Sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum
Si gestiS, iuvenum nobilium cliens
Nardo vina merebere.
Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum,
Qui nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreis
Spes donare noras largus amaraque
Curarum eluere efficax.
Ad quaesi properas gaudia, cum tua
Velox merce veni: non ego te meis
Immunem meditor tingere poculiS,
Plena dives ut in domo. ’ ’
Verum pone moras et studium lucri,
Nigrorumque memor, dum licet, ignium ¹
Misce stultitiam consiliis brevem:
Dulce est desipere in loco.

17. nardi parvus onyx. ‘Onyx' is
properly a kind of marble or alabaster,
so named srom its resemblance in eolour
to the human nail; thena cup or box,
first, of this material; lastly, it would
seem, ol any material. See Prop. 4. 10.
22 ‘murreus onyx'; ‘unguenta optime
serrantur in alabastris,' Plin. N. H. 13. 33
cp. the ἀλάβαστρον μῦρον νάρδου πιστι-
nris of St. Mark 14. 3. Ditr.. who ex·
plains ‘studium lueri' in v. 25, ol the
bargain between the wine and the nard,
quotes the story in the Gospels, as
showing the costliness of the nard (⁶ 300
denarii’=between ,69 and AEro), for
whirgh he also refers to Pliny 12. 26, 13.
2,1 ,59.

18. Sulpiciis horreis. ‘Horrea’
were ‘ stote-houses' of any kind ; see on
3. 28. 7. Here the reference is either
to vaults where wine was to be bought,
or, less likely, to the stote-homes in
which, in later times, we hear of persons
keeping their property ol various kinds
for which they had not room at home.
The name ‘Sulpiciis’ would refer to
the original erector of the buildings, or
possibly, as Orelli thinks, to the pos-

sessor, the produce of whose fann and
vineyard was disposed ofin this way.
Orelli quotes an inscription which makes
mention of some ‘horrea Galbana,'
which would probably be the same as
the ‘Sulpicia' since ‘Galba' was a
cognomen os the gens Sulpicia; and
Porph. asserts that the name ‘Galbae
horrea’ belonged in his time to a
certain store ol wine and oil, etc. The
lorm ‘Sulpiciis' is, as Orelli points
out, regular. Cp. ‘Comeliae Iuliae,
leges'3 ‘Licinia atria,’ Cic. pro Quinct.
