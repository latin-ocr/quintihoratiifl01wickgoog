LIB. III. OD. 1.

Audita Musarum sacerdos
Virginibus puerisque canto.
Regum timendorum in proprios greges, 5
Reges In ipsos imperium est Iovis
Clari Giganteo triumpho,
Cuncta supercilio moventis Ι
Est, ut viro vir latius ordinet
Arbusta sulcis, hic generosior

however, look for the metaphor in every
word of the stanna. It is the epithet
‘profanum’ that seems first to suggest it.
As the mysteries are those of the Muses,
the vehiele of their proclamation will be
‘carmina' The audience are to be
'virgines puerique,’ not because the
chorus that sang hymns in honour of a
god (Carm. S. 6) must be so composed‚
for this would be to introduce a second
metaphor; but because it was to the
young and simple that the poet would
address his precepts of moderate living,
of courage, justice and piety. We
seem to have an echo, and an inter·
pretation, of the imagery of this place
in Epp. 1. 19. 32 foll. ‘Hunc [sc.
Alcaeum] ego non alio dictum prius
ore Latinus Volgavi fidicen; iuvat im·
memorata ferentem Ingenuis oculisque
legi manibusque terreri.’ Verses Ι,
a contain the two proclamations cus·
tomary at solemn ntes, the first to warn
away improper hearers, ’έναι ’έναι όστιο
ἀλιτρόε, Callim. H. in Apoll. υ, ‘Pro-
cul Ο procul este profani.’ Virg. Aen.
6. 258; the second enjoining a sacred
silence on those that remained Arist.
Thesm. 39 εόφημοε rrds ἔστω λεὼε στόμα
συγκλείσαε, Tibull. a. 2. ἰ ‘Dicamus
bona verba .. Quisquis ades lingua vir
mulierque fave? Virg. Aen. 5. 71 ‘Ore
favete omnes! Cp. especially Arist.
Ran. 353 foll. Εὐφημεΐν χρὴ κάξίστασθαι
τοΐε ἡμετέροισι χοροῖσιν Ι ὅστιε ἄπειροι
τοιῶνδε λόγωνῆ γνώμῃ μὴ καθαρεύει l ἤ
γενναίων όργια Μουσῶν μήτ’ εἶδεν μήτ’
ἐχόρευσεν rr. τ. λ.

2. non prius audita. The initiated
are to receives new revelation. The
metaphor, if we are to interpret it, would
seem to include the two ideas, that the
Odes which follow are to be oia higher
mood than their predecessors, and that
the wisdom which theyconvey is strange
to the age.

8. supercilio, after Hom. ΙΙ. r. 528

9-14. ‘Men may differ in fortune
during life. One possesses broad acrem
another, if he is a candidate for office,
can 'offer high birth: a third is a
“novus homo,'’ but has higher personal
reputation3 a fourth has a iarger
number of clients on whose votes he
can reckon.'

9. est ut, ‘it may be that,’ as ‘non
est ut,’ Epp. r. 12. υ. It is needless
with Bentley to alter to ‘esto' The
concessions are balanced in the apodosis
‘aequa lege,' etc.

of humanity. Cp. the same emphasis
