Aemula nec virtus Capuae nec Spartacus acer 5
Novisque rebus infidelis Allobrox,

Nec fera caerulea domuit Germania pube
Parentibusque abominatus Hannibal,

Impia perdemus devoti sanguinis aetas,
Ferisque rursus occupabitur solum. ιο

Barbarus heu cineres insistet victor ct Urbem
Eques sonante verberabit ungula,

Quaeque carent ventis et solibus ossa Quirini,
Nefas videre! dissipabit insolens. ,

Malis carere quaeritis laboribus:

oi Rome lasted so iate that Cicero
plays upon it iu his two speeches, de
Leg. Agr. contr. Rullum.

Spartacus, cp. Od. 3. 14. 193 the
Thracian sreebooter who, having been
taken and sold as a gladiator, escaped,
and was for two years (nc. 7 3-71) the
terror of Rome as the leader of the Ser-
vile war.

’ 6. novis rebus infidelis, ‘the faith-
less ally 01 revolution' (‘rebus' is the
dative), in allusion to the part which
the ambassadors of the Allobroges
played in encouraging and betraying
the Catilinarian conspiracy, Sall. Cat.
41, Cic. in Cat. 3. The Allobroges
stand as the representatives of the
Gauls generally, and the point of the
epithet seems to lie in their saithlcss-
ness, 01 which it called 10 mind a signal
recent instance. Their territory lay be·
tween the Rhone and the isere.

7. caerulea, ‘blue-eyed,’ Juv. 13164

‘Caerula quis stupuit Germani lumina, ·

ο flavam Caesariem.’ The reference is to
the incursione of the Cimbri and Teu·
tones, which were finally checked by
Marius aud Catulus in the battles 01
Aquae Sextiae (0.0. 102) and Raudii
Campi (ac. 101).

8. parentibus abominatus Orelli
and Diua taire ‘parentibus' as ‘our
forefathers,’ but the parallel, Od.1. 1.
²4 ‘bella matribus detestata,' seems
conclusive in favour of the simpler
meaning. Compare the common epi·
rhet, ‘dirus Hannibal?

9. devoti sanguinis, the descriptive
genitive, Madv. t 287. The thought is
the same as that of Epod. 7. ‘There is

a curse on this generation. They draw

their crimes with their blood from their

predecessors.’

b zo. rursus, ‘as before the city was
uit.¹

13. ossa Quirini. Porph. quotes
Varro as saying that there was a tomb
01 Romulus ‘post Rostra’ (⁴ pro Ros·
tris‚' Comm. Cruq.). And Orelli refers,
to this a corrupt and obscure fragment
01 Festus, ‘niger lapis in Comitio lo·
curn funestum significat nt ali (i) Romuli
morti destinatum.’ Horace ignores the
legend of his apotheosis which he adopts
in Od. 3. 3. 15 1011. ‘Martis equis Ache-
ronta iugit’

14. nefas videre, ‘sight 01 shame’3
Virg. Aen. 8. 688 ‘sequiturque nefas,
Aegyptia coniux'; the infinitiva for the
more usual supine ‘mirabile dictu.¹
Grammatically, ‘nefas’ is an accusative
characterising the action oi the ‘dissi-
pabit ossa'

15,16. ‘May be, with one voice, or,
at least, the better part of you, you are
asking what can help you to get quit of
your sad troubles.’

15. melior, explained by v. 37,
bholrpestior ac dignitatis amantior,'

re r.

16. carere‚=‘ad'carendurn.' Bentley,
aster Rurgers, objecting to the ambi-
guity of ‘quid expediat carere'? which
might also mean ‘what is the good 01
getting quit'? would read ‘quod expe·
diat: taking it as equivalent to ‘quod
bene vortat,’ ‘quod felix faustum-
que sit.' The reading has since been
