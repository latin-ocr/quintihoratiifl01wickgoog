HORATII CARMINUM

Quam rem cunque ferox navibus aut equis
ἵ Miles te duee gesserit:
Nos, Agrippa, neque haec dicere, nec gravem
Pelidae stomachum cedere nescii,
Nee cursus duplicis per mare Ulixei,
Nec saevam Pelopis domum
Conamur tenues grandia, dum pudor
imbellisque lyrae Musa potens vetat
Laudes egregii Caesaris et tuas
Culpa deterere ingeni.
Quis Martem tunica tectum adamantina
Digne scripserit? aut pulvere Troico
NIgrum Merionen, aut ope Palladis
Tydiden superis parem?
Nos convivia, nos proelia virginum

Met. 7. 50 ‘matrum celebrabere turba?
Ov. Her. το. 161 ‘Deseror coniuge,'
may be explained perhaps as following
such analogies as ‘orbor' ‘viduor¹.
The alteration ⁶ aliti ' is easy, too much so
to be probable. For ‘ ales' as the title of
a poet, cp. od. 4. a. 25 ⁴ Dircaeum cye-
num‚¹ and the whole idea olOd. 2. 20.

5. quam rem cunque, ‘every ex-
ploit which thy bruve soldiery achieved
by sea or land, led on by thee’; the
construction is as if the previous clause
had run ‘ scribentur fortitudo et victoriae
tuae? The tmesis is common in Horace,
cp. Od. 1. 7. 25, anderen inprose, Cic.
pro Sest. 31 ‘quod iudicium cunque
subierat?

5. neque. .uee,‘weessayno moreto

tell this tale than to tell,' etc, cp. Od.
3· 5· ²7·
6. stomachum. This rendering of
the Homeric μῆνιν οὐλομένην is quoted
by Charisius as an instance of inten-
tional ramirans, which he defines ‘rei
magnae humilis expositio,’ as if it were
an undignified word chosen to show
Horaee's distaste for such a character.
In any case, in respect of this as well as
of ‘duplicis' and ‘saevam’ though the
traits themselves are traditional, their
selection is probably intended to point
a contrast with the milder themes which
Horace prefers. ‘I canum write of the
fierceness aud the craft and the cruelty
of heroic wars.'

7. duplicis πολύτροπος, Hom-3 δι·
πλοῦς ἀνὴρ, Eur. Rhes. 193.

Ulixei, for the form cp. Achillei, 1.
15. 34. and see Madv. ξ 38, obs 3.

8. Pelopis domurn, the theme ra-
ther of the Greek drama than ol Epos;
but Horace is probably alluding to
Varius' tragedy ‘Thyestes' which was
brought out in the year after the battle
of Actium. lt was greatly admired.
‘Varii Thyestes cuilibet Graecorum
comparari potest‚' Quint. ro. r. 98.

10. lyrae puteus, Od. 1. 3. 1.

vetat, see on Od. 1. 3. 10.

rr. egregii, Od. 3. 25. 4, ‘peerless'

12. deterere, lit. ‘to wear the fine
edge off ⁷ ; cp. ‘obterere' Cic. Verr. τ. 5.
1 ‘obteri laudem imperatoriam erimi-
nibus avaritiae‚’ and ‘tenuare’ Hor. od.
3· 3· 7²·

13. tunica tectum adamantino,
χαλκοχίτωναι ‘adamas' is hard steel.

14. pulvere nigrum. Cp. 2. 1. aa.
The ‘dust ' of the Trojan plain occupies
a prominent place in Homer.

16. superis parem, referring to his
woundiug Aphrodite and Ares, iu Hom.
Il. 53 see esp. vv. oar-884 Ἥ (sc.
Pallas) ννν Τυδέος οἷον ὑπερφίαλον Διο-
μήδεα Ι μαργαίνειν ἀνέηκεν ἐπ’ ἀθανάτοισι
θεοῖσιν. l Κύπριδα μὲν πρῶτον σχεδὸν
οὔτασε χεῖρ’ἐπῖ καρπῷ, Ι αὖταρέπειτάὐτῷ
μοι ἐπέσσυτο δαίμονι ἶσοι.

17. nos, not quitess‘ ego,' but gene-
ralizing, ·1 and such as 1:

¹ This was written before the publication of the end ed. of Prof. Mayor's Juvenal. The note which
he inserts by Mr. H. A. J. Monte. on Sat. 1. 13, argues my main point more effectively than lcan.
