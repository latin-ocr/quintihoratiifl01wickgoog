LIB.11. oo. 9.

ODE IX.

‘Tua most continuous taine, the longest winters, end at last. Let not your
grief ior Mystes alone be unending, Valgius. Not even Nestor grieved inconsol-
ably sor the son ol his old age, nor his parents and sisters for the blooming
Troilus ’Tis time to cease from weilings more womanly than theirs, and to sing
of Caesar’s triumphs! ¹

The Ode is addressed to C. Valgius Rufus a poet whose elegies are referred to
and quoted by Servius on Virg. E. 7. aa, and Aen. 11. 457. The scattered and
doubtful hints which can be gleaned about him will be sound in the Dict. Biog.
He stands in Sat. 1. 1o. 82 with Varius, Maecenas Virgil, and the other select iew
sor whose literary approbation Horace cares. The Scholiasts speak oi himas a
‘Consularis' and the name occurs in the Consules Fasti, nc. 12.

The date of the Ode has been a subject of controversy. Vv. 19, 20 can hardly be
unconnected with Virgil's lines, G. 3. 3ο foll.:- f

‘Addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten,
Fidentemque fuga Parthum versisque sagittis

Et duo rapta manu diverso ex hoste tropaea, ,
Bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentes!

In both cases one set ol interpreters see a reference to the year nc. eo, when ’

¹ Augustus was himself in Asia, and Tiberius, under his orders, advanced into

Armenia, and replaced Tigranes on the throne of that country, and alanned
Phraates into restoring the prisoners and standards taken at Chartae. It is
impossible, however, in these poetical references to Augustus' exploits to dis-
entangle anticipation from history or the hyperbolical dress os historical lact.
Horace's language will be sufficiently accounted for by Virgil's, so that, ii with
Heyne we think it unnecessary to imagine that Virgil inserted the lines in question
ten years after the composition of the Georgics and in the year before his death,
we shall think it equally unnecessary to set aside, ior the sake of this Ode, Franke’s
judgment, that the three Books were complete in nc. 23. xSe'e Introdl. to Books iiii,
