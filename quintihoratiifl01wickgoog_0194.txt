LIB. II. OD. 19.

Pauperem' laboribus
Vocatus atque 11011 vocatus audit. 40

40. The form is like Thucyd. 1. suggests that Horace was thinking

Tae poet imagines himself (vv. 1-4) to bave come, while wandering in the hille,
011 Bacchus amldst the Nymphs and Satyrs. He describes dramatically (as though
he felt them 01 the moment) 1110 effects 01 the sight: 1110 110511101101(χαλεποὶ δὲ

11011 1101111111, from its tumultuous excitement. Then he finds the way 01 relies.
He may sing the praises 01 Bacchus; 01 his power to bless those whom he loved

Ἴ and destroy his enemies; 1115 power over inanimate nature, over 11011005 1100515,

over the glanis, over the monsters 01 Hades.

Compare Od. 3. 25. They both seem to be attempts 10 catch something 01 the

a mere study. There is no reason 10 believe that itis 0 reproduclion 01 any single

Dillr. suggests 11101 Horace had been lately reading Euripides Bacchae. That
