86 HORATII CARMINUM

Plectantur silvae te sospite, multaque merces,
Unde potest, tibi defluat aequo

Ab Iove Neptunoque sacri custode Tarenti.
Negligis immeritis nocituram 30

Postmodo te natis fraudem committere? Fors et
Debita iura vicesque superbae

Te maneant ipsum: precibus non linquar inultis,
Teque piacula nulla resolvent. ἵ

Quamquam festinan, non est mora longa3 licebit 35
Iniecto ter pulvere curras

the wind sweeping, or threatening to

sweep, is it be not staycd by Archytas’

30, 31. ‘Art thou careless oi com-
mitting a crime that shall bring punish·

prayer, lrorn one end ol heaven to the ment presently ou thine innocent chil-
other. As the trader is already east of dren? May-be even in tbine own

ltaly, he would more probably be sail-
ing to the east than,like the ‘mereator’
of 1. 31. 14, to the Spanish ports out-
side the Straits,

νγ. plectuntur, in its usual sense
not only ol being lashcd, but ol bear·
ing the punishment3 ‘may all his ven·
geance be wreaked on thern!

multa meroes, ‘a rich reward,’ i. e.
lor your humanity.

28. unde potest, Ι cannot reward
you, but there is that which will, the
favour ol Jove, who (as originally in
his iunction ol ξένιος) presides especially
over the reciprocal duties of rnen to one
another, and ol Neptune the tutelary god

person the debt of justice and a re·
turn of contumely may be in store ior
thee!

te naris, to be talen together, ‘te’
being the ablativa, as in ‘nate Dea‚’
'Apolline natus‚’ etc: the opposition is
to ‘te ipsum.¹ ‘Te' has also been
taken (as by Nauck) as the subj. of
‘committere’ ‘Is it nothing to thee
that thou art committing‚' etc. ‘Negligis
committere’ and ‘negligis te commit-
tere¹ are both possible construetions.

33. nou linquar, i. e. ‘a te.¹ It
thou leavest me my prayers for ven·
geance will not be unheard.

‘unde’ os a person, see on Od. 1. ιν. 17.
