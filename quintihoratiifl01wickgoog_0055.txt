Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum

Ocior aura

Tollat3 hic magnos potius triumphos,

Hic ames dici pater atque princeps,

Neu sinas Medos equitare inultos,
Te duce, Caesar.

Invidet, atque hominum queritur curare
triumphos; Quippe ubi ias versum at-
que nefas,’ etc.

47. nostris vitiis iniquum, ‘in-
tolerant oi,’ ‘ non diutius aequa mente
vitia ferentem? Franke sees in these
words a reference to the censorian
power which Octavianus had accepted
in tlte year rao. 29.

48. aura tollat, keeps up the cha-
racter of the winged Mercury, ever ⁸ on
tiptoe’ for ilight.

49. triumphos. ‘Caesar triplici in-
vectus Romana triumpho Moenia' Virg.
Aen. 8. 7143 ‘Cumles triumphos tres
egit, Dalmaticum, Actiacum, Alexandri-
num: continuo triduo omnes,’ Suet.
Oet. 22.

50. pater. The title of θ Pater pa·
triae’ was not solemnly given to Au-
gustus hythe Senate till rac. 2‚bt1t‚as

ratification of a title which had been
long given him by popular usage:
‘Sancte Pater patriae, tibi Plebs, tibi
Curia nornen Hoc deditr hoc dedimus
nos tibi nornen Eques, Res tamen ante
dedit.¹ It was a title familiar to Rornan
ears, having been given by the Senate
to Cicero (Juv. 8. 243), and in earlier

times to Camillus by the army (Liv. 5.
triincitatissimis,illisa
the column erected in the Forum to
Julius Caesar's memory, Suet. Jul. 85,
Cic. Phil. 1. a. Horace promises (od.
3. ²4· 27) a similar title to any one who
will venture to restrain the licence os
the time, pointing, of course, to Au·
gustus, ‘Si quaeret Pater urbium Sub·
scribi statuis, indomitam audeat Re-
frenare licentiam.' The title of ‘Princeps'
(Οὰ. 4. 14. 6), sc ‘senatus’ must also

tamished by the deleat os Crassus in
rac. 53, and Antony in rao. 56.

equitare, Od. 2. 9. 24.

52. Caesar. The true name of the
incamate Mercury is reserved to be the
last word lest on our ears, the word that
stills all the lears and satisfies all the
doubts of the preceding stanzas.
