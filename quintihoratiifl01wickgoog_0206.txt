ODE lll.

‘De Justiria et Constantia: Firmness of purpose is characterized in vv. 1-8. It is
the virtue by which Pollux and Hercules, and Augustus and Bacchus, rose to
heaven, by which Romulus ouercame the opposition of Juno, and won immortality
ior himself and world-wide empire for Rome. Jusrice is not absent irom the early
stanzas of the Ode, for it is a just as well as a firm purpose which is glorified in
them; but it is the lreynote of Juno¹s speech, vv. 18-68. She yields to the perse·
vering purpose of Romulus and ol Rome. Her wrath was against the ‘periura
Priami domus,’ the ‘unjust judge,' v. 19, the promise-breaker, v. 22, the violator ol
the laws oi hospitality and of marriage, v. a 5. They have been punished, and she
is satisfied. As long as beasts of the field hide their whelps ou th'e tombs oi Priam
and Paris, the Capitol may stand in its glory. Rome may extend her sway over
the world, only let her leave gold in the mine, send her citizens to the world’s end ’
in search ol empire, not of treasure. And let her beware above all things of the
dream of rebuilding the doomed city of Troy. Troy rebuilt, Juno’s wrath will
revive, and the second fall shall be as bad as the first.

The meaning ol the last warning is not clear. Suetonius (Jul. C. 79) mentions
among the various causes ol Julius Caesar’s unpopularitya rumour ‘migraturum
