aequo, caim and just. It is the key-
uote 01 the stanza; it heightens our idea
oi his power, and describes its nature.
The construction is, ‘qui temperat ter·
ram 01 mare, et regit urbes regnaque,’
etc.

49. Newman criticises, not without
justice, 1110 inconsistency between this
stanza and the last. ‘Magnum illa ter-
rorem intulerat’ mars the effect 01 the
picture of imperial caim. Jove, it wonid
seem, was irightened3 the ultimate vic·
1011 was due to other gods. Horace
almost seems to sorget that he has local·
ised the majesty 01 heaven in Jupiter.
His object newis to exalt Pallae, the
representative 01 mind. The Ι1101111101
heaven was cowed, but the mind was
unsbaken.

50. fidens brachiis, χείρεσσι πεποι-
Odere, Hom. Il. 12. 135, but Horace
intends, by the collocation 01 ‘horrida’
to give the force 01 ‘fidens brachiis qui-
bus horrebat.’ Itis 01 the hundred·
handed giant and his fellows that heis
thinking.

51. fratres, Otus and Ephialtes.

quoted by Madv. (L. G. ς 407, obs. 2)

under the regular use (which he distin-
guishes in his Opusc. Academ. a. 119), in
cases where there is definite reference to
a compieted action. The object in view
was not only to place Pelion on Olym·
pus, but to leave it standing there. This
reference is clear in the old use 01 the

So Horace, ‘Ne quis humasse velit,' S.
a. 3. 187; it is analogons to the peri.
conj. in direct prohibition. This, and
not any aoristic use, seems to be the
explanation 01 ‘ue libeat iacuisse,’ in
Virg. G. 3. 43111. So also in the use

has returned to the Homeric arrange·
ment 011110 mountains (omitting Ossa),
which Vir-gil had inverted. But in so
doing he has left the epitbet with what,
in his arrangement, is the least appro-
priate substantive. In Homer and
Virgil, the ‘nodding woods' on the top
add to the picture. ,
