O DE XXVII.

Iu Od. 1. 18 the poet had recommended moderatim] in the use of wine on moral Ἰ
and reiigious grounds, Here his object is the same though the‘ tone is lighter.
The Ode is a dramatic sketch of a bouquet which is degenerating into a drunken
brawi. Horace interrupts it by an appeal, pleysnl in its mixture of the Bacchic
hierophant with the geniai poet of good living. The company would repiy to
their monitor by filling his gloss. ‘On one condition only‚' he says and diverts
them at once from his own lecture and their rising qunrrel to en absorbing interest
in the iove affairs oi Megilie’s brother. his bashiulness his imagined confidences,
Α his mysterioudy hopeless fate.

It is at least an ingenious suggestion of Ritter’s that the ‘Opuntiae freter
Megillae’ is the saruc ns the Xanthias Phoceus oi Od. ο. p, whom Horace banters
on his iove sor a slave girl (the ‘Cherihdis’ on this vrew oi this Ode), neither
Ἴ ‘fidelis' if we read the irony arighi, nor ‘lucro aversa'3 sce the Introd. to that
Ode.

Athen. x. p. 427 A presentes pert of a poem oi Anacreon,'which may have in-
spired the beginning oi this Ode :-·

ἄγε δηῦτε (al. δεῦτε) μηκέθ’ οὕτω
cortino τε κάλαλητῷ

Σκυθικὴν πόσιν παρ’ οἴνῳ
μελετῶμεν ἀλλὰ καλοῖς
ὑποπίνοντες ἓν ὕμνοιε.

NATIS in usum laetitiae scyphis
Pugnare Thracum est: tollite barbarum
, Morem, verecundumque Bacchum ’
Sanguincis prohibete rixis! '

1. notis. Horace‘is fond of the deus,’ the god who removes the re·
hope, ‘nata mecum testa,' Od. 5. 21. 13 straints os bnshfulness‚ Epod. 11. 13.
‘versus male nati,' Epp. 2. 1. 233. Ritter thinks that there is an antithesis

scyphis pugnare 3 cp. Juv. 5. 26 intended between ‘verecundum' (cp.
‘Iurgia proludunt: sed mox et pocula ‘verecundus color,’ 'Epod 17. 21) and
torques Saucius, et rubro deterges vul· ‘sanguineis' the red of the blushing

norurnque cohortem Pugna Saguntina 0. T. 211) and the red stains oi bioody
fervet commisse lagena? quarrei. The construction, ‘Bacchum

2. Thracum see on Od. 1. 18. prohibete rixis’ (cp. Epp. r. 1. 31
9. · ‘nodosa corpus prohibere cheragra’)

3. verecundum, ‘modici Liberi,’ is foundinprose‚ as Cic. de Leg. Mau.
Od. 1. 18. 7. From another point of 7 ‘magnum civium numerum calami«
view Horace calis him ‘inverecundus tete prohibere!
