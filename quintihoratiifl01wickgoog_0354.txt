Feminis prolisque novae feraci

Lege marita,

Certus undenos decies per annos

Orbis ut cantus referatque ludos ,

Ter die claro totiesque grata
Nocte frequentes,

Vosque veraces cecinisse, Parcae,

Iulia de maritandis ordinibus‚’ which §a The perfect tense, because he is

appears to have been enacted in tac. 18.
Some uncertainty haugs over its provi-
sions, for we do not know to what
extent it was altered bytho supplement·
ary law which was passed in ac. 9, in
the consulship of M. Papius Mutilus
and Q. Poppaeus Secundus, and which
causes the whole measure to be cited as
the ‘Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea? It
forbade marriage between persons of
senatorian family and ‘liberrima' im·
posed penalties on celibacy (to the ex·
tent of the forfeiture of all bequestsl
anderen on childless marriages in all
ranks, and held out exemptione and
rewards to the fathers of legitimate
families. Dio briefiy mentions its pro·
visions 54. 163 on the whole matter see
Merivale, c· 33, vol. iv, p. 85 foll. For
another reference to Augustns’ legisla-
tion on this subject see Od. 4. 5. 21, and
cp. Od. r. a. 24.

19. prolis feraoi; Od. 4. 4. 58 '

‘feraci frondis in Algido': cp. 3. 6. 17
and inf. v. ²9 ‘fertilis frugum!

20. marita, as an adjective, ‘the mar-
riage law'3 so Prop. 4. 11. 33 ‘facibus
maritis‚' Ov. Her. 12. 87 ‘sacris maritis?

21. certus . ,orbis ‘that sothe cycle
may be unbroken, and there may never
fail a thronging people to celebrate the
secular games in the hundred and tenth
year' (see lntrod.). The place of ⁶ fre·
quentes’ shews that it is emphatic.

22. For the position of que see on
Od. 1. 50. 6,

concerned, not with their prophecies

{enemim but with their prophecies of
ome's destiny; see on 3. 4. 51.
Paroae3 see onv. 14. Orelli reminds

us that they would be the authors of

. the Sibyllina proph ecies.

26-28. The relative clause seems
rightly taken by Ritter and Dittr. with
‘bona iungite lata,¹ in asimilar construc-
tion to ‘quod felix faustumque sit,' etc..
‘As once and ior aye has been pro·
mised-and Time's landuuade, that may
notbe removed, protect the promise 1-
link happy destinies to those already
accomplished.’ In ‘dictum est‚' Horace
isremember ing the etymology of ⁶ fatum.’
In ‘rerum Terminus’ he is possibly

thinking of the landmark of Roman Ν

empire that might never recede, and its
pledge in the statue of Terminus, who
would not give way even to Jupiter on
the Capitol t0v. Fast. 2. 667 foll.) ; but
the metaphorica] use occurs in Virg.
Aen. 4. 614 ‘Et sic lata Iovis poscunt,
‚hic terminus haeret,’ where we have
reminiscences of Accius Fr. ‘veter
fatorum terminus? and Lacr. 1. 78 ¹
‘alte terminus haerens? Orelli reads ’
‘servat’ after the Aldine edition (Lam-
binus praises, but does not print it). It
has the slightest MS. support, and, as
Bentley remarks, looks like a correction
to suit the rnood of ‘ est' The sentence
‘quod. . servat' vrould then beconstruct-
ed as the object of ⁶ cecinisse!
