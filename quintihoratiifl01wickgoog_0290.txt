INTRODUCTION To· BOOK IV.

mum...

Ternas is no reason to doubt the account given by Suetonius
of the origin of this Book. The occasion and general date of
it are fixed clearly on its own evidence. With the exception of
Ode 6, which is manifestly written at the same time as the Carmen
Seculare, i. e. in s. c. 17, all the Odes that can be dated refer imme·
diately to two events, viz. (Ι) the retum of Augustus to Rome in
a. c. 13, after three years’ absence in Gaul, whither he had gone in the
year 16, on the news of the defeat of Lollius by the Sygambri 3
(a) the double campaign of Drusus and Tiberius in Raetia and
Vindeleia, which occupied the year 15.

The general tone of the Book, as weg as its particular references,
suit the period thus assigned to it. Its opening bears witness to the
interval which separares it from Horace's last essays in lyric verse,
Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 1-10 and 2. r. 111. That interval has brought marked
changes in the poet’s fortunes‚ as well as in the political world. The
contrast of 4. 5 or 15 with 1.1a or 3. 24, is hardly ruore striking
thau that of 4. gwith 1. 1. The sonsof Liuia have taken the
place of Marcellum the military triumphs, and the moral and social
reforms which in the earlier Books were propbecy, are now, tf we
may believe Horace, history3 the Cantabrian, ‘non ante domabilis,'
is no longer a cause of disquiet3 the Parthians have restored the
standards of Charrae‚ and Phraates and his quarrels are sorgotten 3
the vague alarms about the Daciam or projecte of conquest in Britain,
have giren place to real dangers met on the Rhine, and substantial
victories won in the Eastcrn Alps, The position of one name in the
Book marks more clearly still the contrast between the two epoche,
both in respect of the outer world andos Horace's own lif. Mae-
cenaS, whom even in ac. 19 he addressed as ‘prima dicte mihi
summa dicende camena,' is mentioned but once in this Book. His
birthday is the occasion ol Ode 11, and he is spoken ofin terms
