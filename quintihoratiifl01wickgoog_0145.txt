HORATII CARMINUM .

Ludumqne Fortunae gravesque
Principum amicitias et arma
Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribuS,
Periculosae plenum opus aleae,
Tractas et incedis per ignes
Suppositos cineri doloso.
Paullum seuerae Musa tragoediae
Desit theatris: mox ubi publicas
Res ordinaris, grande munus
Cecropio repetes cothurno
Insigne maestis praesidium reis
Et consulenti, Polli0‚ curiae,
Cui laurus aeternos honores
Delmatico peperit triumpho.
'Iam nunc minaci murmure cornuum
Perstringis aurea, iarn litui strepunt,
. 3. iudum Fortunae, Od. 3. ²9· 50, 12. cecropio cothurno. For the ahl.

1. 2. 37. cp. v. 16 ‘Delmatico triumpho,' and
gravas principum amicitias, cp. a. 7. 16 ‘fretis aestuosis,' and see on

Lucan. 1. 84⁶ Tu causa malorum, Facta
tribus dominis communis Roma, nee
unquam In turbam missi feralia foedera
regni. O male concordesl’ etc. It
must not be applied to tlte triumvirate
ol Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus, of
which Horace would not speak in such
terms.

5. nondum expiatis, Od. r. a. 29.

cruoribus, plural of quantity, a. 14.
25, Virg. Aen. 4. 687.

6. aleae, of hazards which no pru·
denec can soresee. Horace’s object is
not to discourage Pollio, but to exalt
the value ol the difficult task which he
is performing.

7. ignes . . doloso, metaphorical, oi
any dangerous business. Callim. 46. a
πῦρ ὑπὸ τῇ archip, Prop. 1. 5. 5 ‘ignotos
vestigia serre per ignes!

9. severae, splemn, stat ly. Cp.
Aristotle’s epithets ol Tragedy and its
subjectS‚ σπουδαῖος, σεμνός.

, 11. ordinaris, aiter the Greek συν·
τάττειν, ol composition. This is the
Scholiast's interpretation; but belone
Bentley the other commentators tookit
to mean, according to a common poet·
ical ligure, ‘tell ol the settlement ol the
State’ Orelli’s abjectior. to this seems

approval of Augustus' policy more dis·
tinctly thau Horace appears to intend. ,

1.6.2 and 3. 5. 5. The relation is ol
the nature ol those classed together as
the ⁴ ablative absolute’; i. e. the adjec-
tive is predicative, and it is not the sub-
stantive alone, hut the substantive and
adjective together which constitute the
circumstance which justifies or limits
the main statement. Pollio's occupa·

tion is a ‘losty calling‚’ because the

‘huskiu' which he wears is that of the
Attic stage.

14. consulenti, absol. ‘in its coun-
sels’ Like ‘maestis' it describes the
time at which Pollio’s services would he
most needed.

Pollio. There seems to be force in
the reservation of Pollio's name lor this
placawhen our interest has been roused
iorthe forthcoming history, ‘ the history
written‚’ Horace would say. ‘not hya
bystander‚ but by the great orator,
statesmam warrior.' Compare a more
evident instance of art in the collocation
of a name, in the conclusion of Od.
1. a. ¹

curiae, ‘the senate? Cp. Od. 5. 5. 7.

16. Delmatico,Virg.E. 8. 6loll. Poi-
lio was sent by Antony against the Par-
thini, an Illyrian tribe who had espoused
the cause ol Brutus and Cassius. He
defeated them, and took their chief town,
Salonae. For the ablative see above on
v. 12.
