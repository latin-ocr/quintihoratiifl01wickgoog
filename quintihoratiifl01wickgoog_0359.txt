All the indications of date to be discovered in the poems them-
selves fix thern to the first period of his life as an author. Their
references to current politice, both positively, as in the allusions to the
war with Sextus Pompeius, and negatively, in the vagueness with
which they deal with the general situation at horne (see on Epod.
7 and 16), belong to the decade between the battles of Philippi and

Actium. We notice in their style indicatione which point the same
way—occasional harshnesses of construction, a redundancy of
, epithets, a tendency even in the best poems to poetical common·
place, we may add a grossness of subject and language, which his
mature taste would have 'pruned away. The Epodes stand with the
Satires at the opening of Horace's literary life—not unconnected
with them in tone, nor in their literary antecedents, nor in their
treatment in his hands. The Roman Satirist, he tells us, looked, for
all but the poetical form of his composition, to Greek Comedy. ln
the Epode he has returned to the personal lampoon‚ the earliest use
of poetry for purposes of attaek and sericatum, and that of which
Comedy‚ according to Aristotle (Poet. l. c), was the development.
It is in the taste which leads him for models to Lucilius and Archi-
lochus, rather than in any bitterness of special poems, that we may
trace probably his own description already referred to (Epp. a. a. 51 ;
see Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 1) of the personal motives that first drove
him to write poetry. ln any case it is characteristic of the man that
his Satires should mellow and lrumanize into the Epistles, and that
the Epodes should drop so early their ἰαμβικὴ ἰδέα, and soften and
generalize into the Odes. The process in both cases is nearly
complete before the name of the composition is changed.

Horace speaks himself (Epod. 14) of the Book as preparing for
publication, and as having occupied some space of time in com-
position. The date of its publication is generally held to be fixed by
the relation between Epod. 9 and Od. 1. 37, to the year ao. 31-30.
