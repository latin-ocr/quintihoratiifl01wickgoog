HORATII CARMINUM

O D E XXIV.

‘chuss and luxurieris abodes can stay neither care nor death. The Scythians
live more wisely‚ with no settled homes, no stores of wealth. They have not the
vices of civilized lif . Their women do not poison their step—children, nor rule
their husbands, nor break their marriage vows Who would be known as the
saviour and father of his country? Let him check the licence of the time. He
may be hated by his contemporaries, buthe will be giorious to all ages. It is no
good to complain :uponish the offenders :mno good to make lawe, while our lives

, give the lie to thern, while we scour sea and land for the sake of money, and think

poverty the one shame. Let us get quit of our wealth: root out the evil if we are
really tired of it, and train our sons in a manlier school. Let thern hunt instead
oi playing with the Greek hoop and the dice, while their fathers are cheating to
heap up money for them, their unworthy heirs. Thai is the way wealth grows; and
it is an endiess business, for it never ean keep pace with desire'

The Ode travels over the same ground as Odes 1-6 of this Book, which seem in
fact expansions of texts from this one. It must have been written about the same
time, though probably before them. We may note also how many of its expresu
sions recur in the Odes ¹(especially5 and 15) os Book iv, which celebrate Augustus‘
acts as accomplished.

in the text, but rather thatin default of
conclusive evidence on the subject, this
reading seems to have acquired a certain
right of possession from the favour of
several generations of editors. ‘Apuli-

way is that it seems to carry with it the
necessity for the alteration of ‘Tyr-

conjectured ‘terrenum' which occurs in
the sense of ‘land' in Liv. 23· 19, and
Keller and Mr. Munro (though the
latter grudgingly) accept it. The name
‘Tyrrhenum' appears as ‘Tirrenum' in
several good MSS, though this is not
more misspelling than is to bs looked
for with proper names. The Schol. of
Acr. and Porph. is favourable to the
