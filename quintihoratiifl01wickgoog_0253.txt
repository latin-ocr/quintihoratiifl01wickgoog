220 HORATII CARMINUM

had meant to say, ‘Yon are a great man at Formiae at least, in the horne of your
heroic ancestor.' He professes to foresee a rainy day, and bids Lamia use the
dry weather to house his wood and prepare for to-morrow’s festival. The connec-
tion of thought we may compare with r. 9. That Ode will show that it is not
necessary, from the mention of thesea, to suppose that Lamia was at Formiae.
ln both probably the stormy westher, if not actually allegorical, is used to enforce
a moral beyond that which appears on the suriace. The one other certain refer-
ence to Lamia in Horace'spoems(0d.1. 26), and another probable one (Ep. 1.
14. 6), suggest to us that he was a man before whom his friend would desire to set
the sunny side of life.

Vv. a—5 have been condemned hy many critias with no support froin external
evidence; but the Introduction which their omission would leave would not be
more free frorn difficulties thau the unmutilated one. Peerlkamp more consisteutly
condemns the Ode.

an epithet quite without bearing on the

dreariness and odiousness of the storm

the cheer which there may be within.
Its work is purely destructive; it brings
down the leaves which are of use, and
strews the shore with seaweed which is
ofnouse.
