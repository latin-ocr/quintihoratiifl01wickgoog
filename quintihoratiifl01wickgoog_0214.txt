times the two names belonged to the
same instrument, but they were subse-
quently distinguished. The ‘cithara'
whose invention was ascribed to Apollo,
was like a modern guitar, its stringe
- stretched over the sounding body; the
‘lyra,' which remained the property of
Hermes (Epod. 13.9 ‘fide Cyllenea ¹),
had its strings open on both sides like a
harp. Bentley, and most subsequent
editors, have altered ‘ve' to ‘que‚’ so
that ‘fidibus citharaque' will be:
‘fidibus citharae! Cp. Virg. Aen. 6.
120 ‘ Threicia cithara fidibusque canoris,¹

ean hear, oris ita ‘⁴ fine sancy” of mine'l

amabilis insania, an oxymoron;
madness, but one of which l should not
wish to be cured. Horace claims the
ἐνθουσιασμός, μανία (Plal. Phaedr. p.
245 A) of apoet.

6. p'ios lucos, not, as Acron inter·
preted it, of Elysium, but of the woods
which the Muses haunt: Μουσῶν νάπαι,
Plat. Ion, p. 534 A. Cp. Od. 1. 1. 50,
3. ²5· a, 4. a. 30, 4. 3. 10. ‘Pios’either
=⁴sacros,'‘haunted by gods,' or because
the ‘profanum vulgus' is excluded from
them, 3. 1.1 foll.

9. me fabfflosae. The emphasis on
‘me’ points ont the connection with the
preceding stanzas, ‘no wonder that l
should hear the Muses’ voice, though
you do not. I have been their favourite
from my babyhood.'

fabulosae, ‘legendary' ‘De quibus
fabulantur poetae.⁵ They are the birds
of Venus that draw her car; they carry
ambrosia to Zeus himself (Hom. Od.
12. 62), The suggestion is that their
action in covering the child-poet in
leaves was, like their actions of which
legends tell, ‘non sine Dfs'3 and, as
Conington remarks, the emphatic con·
junction ‘me sabulosae‚’ etc. is as much
as to say, ‘1‚'too‚ like other poets (as
Stesichorus, Pindus, Aeschylus), have a
legend ol my infancy!

Volture, now Monte Voltore, a
mountain 4433 feet high, some five miles

west of Venusia, near the point where
Apulia, Samnium, and Lucania join.

10. nutricis, so Keller, with the
oldest MSS; but it is hard to account
for the variant ‘altricis’ which divides
the authorities with it.

extuat· limen Apuliae. This is the
reading of the great number of MSS, and
apparently was foundbyAcr.and Porph.
It is usually interpreted of part ol Ml.
Vultur, just beyond the berder line. Ho-
racedwells onthe characterof the neigh-
bourhood as ‘dybateable land’ on the
frontier of the two provinces, Sat. a. 1. 54
⁸ Lucanus an Apulus anceps,’ etc. There
is, however, sorne reason for suspecting
that this reading was an early corrup·
tion. The minuteness of the local de·
scription and its paradoxical form have
no special point; and the instances
quoted from other poets of variation of
the quantity in such names as Italus
ltalia; Priamus Priamides; Sicanus,
etc. are hardly parallel to the inversion
of the quantity of two syllables iu the
same word, in the same part of two
consecutive lines. lt is doubtful, be·
sides, whether the Roman poets ever
shortened the first syllable of Apulia.
The only instance alleged is the ‘mare
Apulicum' of 3. 24· 4, where the read·
ing is at least asdoubtlul as the present
one. Meanwhile, of the oldest MSS.
(we have no testimony with respect to
V) the Berne and the Paris A, in its
first reading, have ‘limina Pullie,’ and
the Scholiast on γ reads the same, and
explains it as the proper name of the
nurse. Aer. and Porph. seem to have
read ‘Apuliae’ but, oddly, to have
interpreted it in the same way: ‘Fabu-
losam nutricem appellavit quod hae fere
alumnis suis narrare fabulas solent.
Extra limen fabulosae Apuliae meae
nutricis. Provinciae nomen posuit pro
nutricis,' Aer. So also on v. 19, Aer.
‘extra casae limen.¹ ‘Pollia ’ or ‘Pullis'
is a name that occurs in several inscrip-
tions. lt is barely possible then that we
have here the name of Horace's nurse,
