tubex ou neruus. 387

by the necessary amount of excision, or by the supposition of some
lines having fallen out. It will be seen, on examination that the diffi-
culties of 4. 8. 17 have been exaggerated3 and, at any rate, in the
absence of any indication of such a quaternary division, either in the
pauses of the Odes themselves, or in the grammatieal and metrioal
writers (who are usually keen-eyed for ‘lans' in the greater poets),
the chief recent editors have not thought it necessary to alter the Ode
in obediente to the canon. Steiner pointed out that, whatever may
have beeu the case with the Odes which are composed in conplete,
there are but five other Odes besides 4. 8 (omitting, again, 3. 12)
which are μονόστιχα, or ol unisona mette, and that this is too srnall an
area for such an important induction. ¹
