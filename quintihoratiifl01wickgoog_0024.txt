was one of the commentatore used by Porphyrion from the composer
or composers of the Scholia which now bear the name, and which
were composed by some one who had Porphyrion’s commentary in

those in the Foarth Book and most of the Epoyes) belonging to the
earlier half of the century ; the remainder he places in the second half,

same year. Art edition, publisbed at Venice in 1492, contained,
