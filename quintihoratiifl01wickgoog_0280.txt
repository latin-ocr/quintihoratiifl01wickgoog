LIB. ΙΙΙ.

OD. 27. ,ι

Impudens liqui patrios Penates
Impudens Orcum moror. O deorum

Si quis haec audie, utinam inter errem

Nuda leones!

Antequam turpis macies decentes
Occupet malas teneraeque sucus
Defluat praedae, speciosa quaero

Pascere tigres, '
Vilis Europe, pater urget absens:

Quid mori cessas?

Potes hac ab'orno

Pendulum zona bene te secuta
Laedere collum.

Sive te rupes et acuta leto

Saxa delectant, age te procellae

‘tauri’ but, as Orelli observes, this read-
ing was probably a gloss, helped to
usurp the text by v. 7²· Europa has¹
called it, iu ν. 45, ‘infamem iuvencum’
but she has learnt long ago that it was
not merely what i seemed. It should
be noticed that Horace imagines the
bull to have vanished the moment he
has lauded Europa on the Cretan shore.
She is then alone, conscious that she
hasbeen brought there for a bad pur-
pose, but thinking (vv. 65-65) of some
earthly ravisher, such as Paris, etc„ till
Venus appears to reconcile her to the
honour intended for her by Jupiter.

50. impudens, She repeats it, as
though she had now found the clue to
her conduct, ‘chameless' from begin·
ningtoend.

Oreum moror, ‘keep Death wait-
rn .’

g51. stautandin The second person
ol the verb is used by a kind os attrac-
tion, as the doubt ‘si quis' cannot be
addressed toa single person. ‘ Ο dii, si
auditis,' or ‘O deus, si quis deorum
audit' Dill‘. compares Virg. Aen. 4.
684 ‘Exoriare aliquis nostris ea ossibus
ultor!

53-56‚ The point of this stanza is not
quite obvious. Orelli thinks she depre-
cates a tedious death, and quotes Soph.
Ant. 817 foll. οὕτε φθινάσιν πληγεῖσα νό-
aare, οὔτε ξιφέων ἐπίχειρα λαχοῦσ’ ἀλλ’
αὐτόνομοι ζῶσα μόνη δὴ θνατῶν Ἀ’ἰδαν
καταβήσει. We might add the prayer
ol the Chorus in Aesch. Ag. 1448 foll.

s

sor death, but with the same reservation,
φεῦ ris ἂν ἐν τάχει μὴ περιώδυνος μήτε
δεμνιοτήρηι μόλοι, ιι. τ. λ. But probably
the thought is rather that she would
make haste and lether young beauty,
the hated cause ol her present condition,
gain her a death before it too vanished.
It may at least be of some use if it
makes her a dainty morsel for a tiger.
She loathes her beauty: it is not that
she would spare it from withering‚ or
herself from seeing it wither.

fa 58. hae ab orno, ‘you need not look
r?

59. beno=‘opportu11e’; ep. Aesch.
Suppl. 457 foll.

60. laedere, ‘to break· ; more usually
‘elidere' a consciens μείωσιι. Cp.
Soph. Ant. 5'4 πλεκταῖσιν ἀρτάναισι
λωβᾶται βίον. It is a common mode ol
sels-destruction in the heroic legends.
Cp. Joeasta (Ant. lc), and Antigone
herself, ib. 1221 τὴν μὲν κρεμαστὴν αὐχέ-
vos κατείδομεν βρόχῳ μιτώδει σινδόνας
(=‘zona ’) καθημμένην.

6ι. leto, the dative ol the purpose
with respect to which they are sharp.
Dinr. points out the bitterness of ‘delec-
tant' The only reason the father for
the moment can imagine why she should
not hang herself, is that she is caught
by the charms of some other form of
death.

62. procellae, the swist stormwind.
The idea seems to be that sheis to trust
herself to the wiugs of the wind, which
will carry her quick to the bottom.
