⁴ LIB. I.

OD. 17.

Defendit aestatem capellis

Usque meis pluviosque ventos.
Impune tutum per nemus arbutos
Quaerunt latentes et thyma deviae

Olentis uxores mariti,

Nec virides metuunt colubras, ,
Nec Martiales Haediliae lupos,
Utcunque dulci, Tyndari, fistula

Valles et Usticae cubantis

Levia personuere saxa.
Di me tuentur, dis pietas mea

3. defendit, Virg. E. 7. 47 ‘Solsti-
tium pecori defendite.¹

4. usque. The ‘frequent' visits of
Faunus have consented ‘perpetual' salu·
brity on Lucretilis.

5. rutum, pred, ‘without risk, sor it
is sale in his guardianship.’ Bentley is
needlessly offended at the repetition,
and would read ‘totum’ Ritter points
out that stress is laid on the quiet and
security oi the place; there are no
vipers nor wolves for the goats no tipsy
Cyrus sor Tyndaris.

arbutos, the rushes, not the berries,
lor it was the leaves that the kids liked,
Virg. G. 3. 300 ‘frondentia capris Ar·
buta sufficere!

6. latentes. ‚deviae The two adj.
are correlative, and so really belong
each to both clauses. The arbutus may
be hidden in a thicket of other shrubs‚
the thyme may grow only in nooks, but
the goats may stray salely to search for
both.

7. uxores, Virg. E. 7. 7‘Vir gregis
ipse caper’r G. 3. 125 ‘pecori mari·
tum’

8. virides, possibly, as Orelli and
Ritter think, with the idea that thev
- colour indicated their poisonous cha·
racter. But any epithet makes a dan-

. ger more terrible which helps our

imagination to realize any oi its cir-
cumstances more vividly.
9. Martiales, an habitual epithet, as

only between ‘haediliae' and ⁴ haedilia.’
Acron read the latter, and interprets it
‘Septa hedorum.’ But Bentley shows
conclusively that seven if the Romans
had used ‘haedilia’ rather than ‘ca-
prilia' (Varr. R. R. a. 3. 8, as they use
‘ovila’ not ‘agnile'k- it would be the
plural of ⁴ haedile’ with the i long and
the α short. Bentley himself defends
the suggestion of ‘ haeduleae,’ ‘kids’
(Auratus had conj. ‘haedulei’ following
the analogy os ‘equuleus’ ‘equula,’
‘hinnuleus’). We have to weigb the
probability ol such an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον
against the probability ol the name
of some wood or hill near the sarm
being otherwise unknown to us.

11. cubantis, the meaning of the
epithet cannot be certainly known till
we are sure what ‘Ustica' was, which
it qualifies. Is it ⁶ low-lying‚' of a val-
ley, or some spot in a valley; Theoc.

13. di metuantur. He sums up
the previous stanzas. The thought was

nasaniae. The oldest MSS. vary

the wider idea that the Fann and its

owner are under the special protectiou

oi heaven.
