nineteen Sapphic Odes. These follow the common order, though
the distinction of Books is not marked. They are succeeded by some
of the Epodes then by the Carm. Sec, then by the remaining Odes
and Epodes‚ also in their usual order. The Ars Poet. 1-440 follows
the Epodes‚ then Sat. 1. 1, 2 and part of 3. The omissione in the
Odes and Epodes are as follows :—of whole Odes in Book l, Odes
3-7‚ 9‚11, 33 and 343 in Book Ill, Ode33 and of Book IV, Odes3
