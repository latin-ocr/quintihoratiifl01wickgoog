agree that they had only been celebrated four times before the age of
Augustus. There is no trace of the name ‘Seculares' before that
date, and what is said of the different celebratione goes to show that
they were called forth hy special emergencies not by any recurrence
of epoche. Still, there would seem to have been some tradition of
such recurrence to justify Augustus' revival. On the dates of the
celebratione Censorinus' authorities differed. The length of the
‘seculum’ itself was diversely given atrro, as by Horace, and 100
years, as by Val, Antias, Livy, and Varr0, whom Censorinus quotes.

The historical performances are at varying periods‚ but all with
some reference to an intended secular date. Merivale writes, ‘The
emperor Claudius repeated the garnes in the year Anne. 800, dis-
regarding those of Augustus as irregular. Claudius was disregarded
in his turn by Domitian, who renewed the celebration ln 841, antici-
pating in his impatience, by six years, the period prescribed by
Augustus. To the Augustan computation Severus conformed pre-
cisely, and repeated the solemnity in 9¹57, after two intervals of 110
years each. Philippus, however, returned once more to the precedent
of Claudius in the year of the City 1000. This was the last celebra·
tion'

The occasion of Augustus' revival or institution of these games
was the close of what rnay be considered the first decade of the
empire, the renewal to him (though professedly only for five years
more), at his own sequen, of the ‘imperium' which in ac. ατ he had,
apparently with difficulty, been persuaded to accept for ten years

The ‘quindecimviri' (see on v. 70, and cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 7 3), the
custodiens of the Sibylline Books, found in thern the requisite instruc-
tions. Ateius Capito, a great jurist. and antiquarian, was appointed
to settle the ceremonieS, and Horace totcompose the hymn. Some
doubt has been entertained whetherthis was to be performed in the
temple of Apollo Palatinus on the third day of the festival (see below,
extract from Ζος. l. 33), or during the sacrifices at the Tarentum on ’
the first night (th. l. ar).
