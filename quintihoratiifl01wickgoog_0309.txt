HORATII CARMINUM

lam lacte depulsum leonem
Dente novo peritura vidit:
Videre Raeti bella sub Alpibus
Drusum gerentem Vindelici ;-quibus
Mos unde deductus peremne
Tempus Amazonia securi
Dextras obarmet, quaerere distuli,
Nec scire fas est omnia ;-sed diu
Lateque victrices catervae

Sensere, quid mens rite, quid indoles 25
rNutrita faustis sub penetralibus ,

16. peritura vidit, ‘looks up, and
sees a moment before she dies by his
untieshed rooth! The repetition ‘vidia’
‘videre' points the correspondence, and
makes it easier to dispense with a more
formal introduction oi the apodosis; see
on a. 9. 9.

17. Raeti. attenderint. lt is hard
to say which is the adjective. Geogra-
phically Raeti is the iar-ger name of the
two, being used to cover Vindelicis
(Raetia secunda) or the northern slopes
of the Alps, from the Lake of Constance
to the lnn, as wellas Raetia prima,
the southern part of the Gn'sons and the
western Tyrol. Horace has, the author·
ity of Dio C. 54. aa, in giving the com·
mon name of Raeti to the tribes which
Tiberius (Od. 4. 14. 14) and Drusus
conquered. But itis certainlya perver-
sion of the ordinary„ usage to assign the
Vindelici, both here and in 414, to the
invadet who approached, from the south.
The geographical difficulty is unaffeeted
by the question of reading raised by
Heinsius, Bentley, and others, as whe-
ther we read ‘Raetis' or ‘Raeti' the
two names will stili be given to one
locality, and that the scene oi Drusus’
victory. The MSS. and Aer. are in
favour eithenominative. The ablativa,
distributing the two names between the
mountains and the pcepta would be
more in accordante with Horaee's style,
and it would avoid the awkwardness,
however it be explained, of the double
designation.

18-22. quibus . . sed. The digres-
sion is intended to elevate Drusus' vic·
tory, by suggesting an immemoriai and
legendary antiqnity for his enemies. Its
prosaio introduction, contrasting awk-

watdly with the smooth finish of Ho-
race’s style, isan intentional, if not very
successful, imitation of Pindar. Cp. a
slighter instance in 3. 4. 69. Many
critics (Lambinus. Buttmann. Meineke.
amongst them) have been tempted, by
the fact that their excision would cause
little or no disturbance of the mette. to
condemn the lines as an interpolation,
supposing the sentence to haverun ‘Vin-
delici diu’ or ‘Vindelici et diu? But
the saulis of the verses are such as the
poet is much more likely to have been
guilty esthan an imitator. They formed
part of the text in the time of Servius
rou Virghen. r. 243)-

19. per omne ternpus, ‘through all
timei historicaIly.

20. Amazonia, such as the Amazone
medi ‘securigeras puellae,' Ov. Her. 4.
117. Horace would suggest apparently
in this word that there is some mythical
reason for their carrying the weapon.
There need not have been any definite
legend, such as Porph. imagines, that
they had fought with the Amazona or
as Servius, that they traeed their descent
to them.

21. oberraret, ‘arms for offence,’ a
rare word, found in an epigram (25) of
Ausonius

aa. The termination of the digression
in a morai saying, with a rapid retum
to the straight course of the narrative, is
aster Pindar. ‘Seu' like δ’ οὖν in the
Greek tragedians, impiies aretum to the
threadoithestory,‘howeverthatmaybe.'

24. revictae, ‘conquered in their
turn? answering to ‘victrices’

25. mens, rather of the intellect;
indoles of the temper and dispositions;
rite, fauetis, penetralibus, are all
