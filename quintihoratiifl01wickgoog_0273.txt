HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XXV.

In this Ode, asin 2. 19, Horace has tried to catch the inspiration of a Greek
dithyramb. ln that one he professes to recall the effects which the sight of
Bacchus had upon him: inthe present one he is actually under the influence of
the afflatus. ‘He is hurried away, whither he knows not: his eyes are opened on
strange eavems and river-bauks and woods. His tongue will be loosed in a
moment to sing no humble theme, and in no common strain, the glories ol Caesar:
he follows the god, for he must, audit is delightiul, but it is seariul too!

The glory ol Caesar is only mentioned as the subject of the coming burst of
song3 but the place ol honour given to it is in effect the celebration which is
promised. See 1. 6, Introd.

QUO me, Bacche, rapis tui
Plenum? quae nemora aut quos agor in specus
Velox mente nova? quibus

Antris egregii Caesaris audiar
Aeternum meditans decus
Stellis inserere et consilio Iovis?

r. tui plenum 2. 19. 6 ‘pleno meditans π μελετῶν, ‘planning’
Bacchi pectore? ‘practising.' Possibly also it suggested

2. For the omission of the preposition
with the first substantive cp. Epp. 2. r.
²5 ‘Vel Gabiis vel curn rigidis aequata
Sabinis: Virg. Aen. 6. 692 ‘Quas ego
te terras et quanta per aequoro vectum
Aspicio.' It was a Greek licence; cp.
amongst others Soph.O.T. 734 σχιστὴ δ’
etas 'Es ταύτὸ Δελφῶν κάπὸ navatus dyst.

3. velox mente nova. The inspira·
tion so alters him that he can hardly re-
cognize his soul as his own, and it endows
him with the swiitness of thought.

quibus antris, local ablative.

4-6. The constr. is ⁶ audiar, meditans
inserere’ Horace already ‘meditatur
inserere‚' etc. The question is where
his dreamings will find voice and an
auditory.

4. egregii, r. 6. 11.

5. aeternum is pred, ‘to set Caesar’s
glory as a new star in the skies lor
ever!

the idea, which it olten conveyS, of
poetical composition as the means of
conferring the promised glory: ‘rnedi-
tari’ is used in the sense oi ¹ composing
aloud’ in Virg. E. 6. 82 ‘Omnia quae
Phoebo quondam meditante beatus
Audiit Eurotas)

6. oonsilio Iovis, ‘the eouncil board
oi Jupiter! Virgil's ‘quem rnox quae
sint habitura deorum Concilia‚' G. 1. 24,
is hardly as high a compliment to
Augustus' wisdom. Bentley would fol-
low a minority of MSS. in reading ‘ con-
cilio' here also; but Orelli points out
that as ‘concilium' means only a
‘gathering’ ‘concilium deorum* is a
natural expression, ‘concilium Iovis'
scarcely so. The general terms in
which Caesar's apotheosis is spoken of
arethe same in the two passages. In
both he is at one moment to be a god,
at another a star.
