6 INTRODUCTION TO THE

and grounds of the keen interest taken in Parthian affairs, and of the
stress laid on the mission of Augustus to restore Roman prestige in
the East, yet all fall without the period assigned for the composition
of the Odes. The only contemporaneous event of Parthian history
is that which is related by Dio 51. 18, and by Justinus 42. 5. 5.
Phraates IV, to whom Orodes I had resigned his throne in sc. 38,
after some years of tyranny, provoked his subjeets to the point of
rebellion. He was expelled, and Tiridates, another member of the ’
Arsacid house, though his exact relationship to Phraates is unknown,
was put on the throne in his place. After a short tirne Phraates was
restored (Justinus adds, by the intervention of the Scythiam, which
explains probably the allusion of Od. 1. 26. 3-5), and Tiridates fied
to seek the¹ protection of Augustus carrying with him the infant son
of Phraates These events are undoubtedly the objects of reference
in Od. r. 26. 5, a. 2. 17, 3. 8. 19, and very probably also in 1. 34. 14*
16 and 3. 29. 28. If we could date them therefore with certainty we
should know the earliest time at which the first-named Odes at least
could have been written. And it so happens that this would inciden-
tally throw light on one or two more points of Horatian chronology

for 3. 8 is written on an anniversary (it seems almost necessarily the
first anniversary) of Horace's escape from the falling tree. To fix,
therefore, the earliest date of this Ode would determine as much for
the other Odes which refer to the accident, ie. 2. 13 and 3. 4.
Horace’s escape again is connected (2. 17. 21-30) with Maeeenas’
reception in the theatre on his recovery from illness, arrd this in its
turn gives a date of some kind to 1. 2ο. The date, however, on
which so much depends is not itself quite free from doubt. lustinus
says that Tiridates fied to Augustus, ‘who was at that time fighting in
Spain,' which would fix the date to rac. a 5. Dio, on the contrary,
narrates the event under the year go, and makes Tiridates find
Augustus in Syria, on his progress through Asia after the battle of
Actium. This seems more probable in itself than the story of his
journey to Spain ; and the earlier date is the one now generally
accepted. A confirmation of it is found in Od. 3. 4, which contains
a reference to the falling tree, and which yet, both by its relation to
the other Odes at the beginning of Book iii, and by the allusion of
v. 37 foll, seems to be fixed to a date earlier than nc. 26-25.
Another point of some interest has been supposed to be involved in
the date of Tiridates’ fiight. Two of the Odes which refer to this
event (3.8 and 29) speak also of Maecenas as burdened with cares of
State in a way in which no other Ode speaks of him. ‘Mitte civiles
