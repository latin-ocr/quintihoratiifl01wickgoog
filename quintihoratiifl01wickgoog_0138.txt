nna. 1. on. 36.

Neu promptae modus amphorae,
Neu morem in Salium sit requies pedum,

Neu multi Damalis meri

Bassum Threicia vincat amystide,

Neu desint epulis rosae,

Neu vivax apium, neu breve lilium.

Omnes in Damalin putres

Deponent oculos, nec Damalis novo

for which the Greeks called suller’s earth
Κιμωλὲα γῆ (Ar. Ran. 713. Ov. Met. 7463
‘CretosaqueruraCimoli')from Cimolns
one of the Cyclades, whence they
obtained it. He pointed out that where
he is writing ‘sermoni propiora,' he calls
it simply ‘creta'; S. r. 3. 246 ‘Creta an
carbone notandi.' Horace is referring
to what was doubtless merely aprover·
bial mode oi expression among the
Romans. 'Pliny attributes ¹it· as an
actual custom to a Thracian tribe, ‘quae
calculos colore distinctos pro experi-
mento cuiusque diei in urnam condit ac
supremo die separatos dinumerat atque
ita de qnoque pronunciat,’ N. H. 7. 40.
The Latin poets are lull of allusions to
such a fancied symbolic practice. Cp.
Mart. 12. 34 (where he is reviewing his
thirty-four years of intercourse with his
kinsman Jul. Martialis) ‘Quarum dulcia
mista sunt amaris, Sed iucunda tamen
luere plura: Et' si' calculus omnis h‘uc et'*
illucDiversushicolorquedigeraturVincet
candida turba nigriorem.’ For briefer
references Catuli. 68. 148 ‘Quem lapide
illa diem candidiore notat'; 106. 6 ‘ O
lucem candidiore nota’; Pers. a. 1
‘Hunc Macrine diem numera meliore
lapillo.' Some early critics altered
‘Cressa’ to ‘Thressa’ on the ground
apparently ol the story in Pliny. The
Schol. justify ‘Cressa‘ by relating the
same story of the Cretans; but, as
Bentley remarked‚ whether they were
Thracians or Cretans they used black
stones as well as white, so that the
epithet would not imply the colour of
the stone to he used.

11. promptae, pred, the wine jar
must be brought ont (⁶ cellis depromere
avitis,' Od. 1. 37. 5), and when brought
there must be no stint of it.

12. Cp. r. 37. 1 ‘pede libero Pulsanda
tellus! The words morem in Salium
occur again in Od. 4. 1. 28. ‘Salium'
may be the gen, as ‘Boeotum' Ep. 2.

1. 244, or more probably the accus. ol
the adp* Salius,' which occurs in Fest,
oi tihi dotalitii {sii}

to the longer ‘Saliaris’ Dancing was ·

apart of the ceremonies observed by
the Salii in the festival of Mars (Liv. 1.
το), and according to Ovid (Fast. 3.
587 ‘a saltu nomina ducta’) was the
origin of ttieir name.

,132 multi meri, imitated by Ovid,
Met. 14. ²5² ‘multique Elpenora vini.'
Cic. ad Fam. 9. 26, describes a man as
‘hospes non multi cibi, sed multi ioci?
Itis an extension of the descriptive gen.
‘pusilli animi: etc.. Madv. 5 287, with
obs. 3. Bassus, whose usual character
is clearly intended to contrast with that
oi Damalis-in this respect, is on this
occasion to rival her in taking deep
dranghts of wine, ἀμυστί, ie. without
closing the mouth admonet.

1'4. Bassum. The Roman name
almost implies that a real person is
intended. There was a Bassus a poet-
ical friend of Ovid (Trist. 4.10.47), and
one (or two) contemporary witti Cicero:
but none'is known to us· whose date
would· well suit 'this reference. By
Martial’s time the name has from this
passage become proverbial for a hard
drinker '(Mart. 6. 69).

Threicia, cp. Callim. Fr. 109 rol γὰρ
ὁ Θρηϊκίην μὲν ἀπέστυγε χάνδον ἄμυστιν
ζωροποτεῖν. Orelli recalls Hector's
taunt to Rhesus the Thracian (Eur.
Rhes. 405), orire ἐν δεμνίοις πυκνὴν ἄμυ-
στιν o‘rs σὺ δεξιοὺμενσι. For the Thra—
cian habits, see on Od. 1. 18. 8.

16. vivax, breve. Merely lor the
pleasure of the antithesis, cp. Od. 2. σο.
9. 11 ‘asperae leves? ‘Breve' ‘short-
lived‚' as ‘breves flores rosae‚’ Od. 218.
13. The flowers are ior garlands sor
the goests.

17. putres =‘ lascivos?

18. novo, sc. Numida.
