are two other instances where a prepositiou at the beginning ofa
composite word gives a quasi-caesura, 1. 16. 21 ‘Hostile aratrum
exercitus insolens,' 1. 37. 5 ‘Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum!
Horace seems to have pald great attention to the rhythrn of verse β,
excluding‚ and more careiully in his later poenis, all conjunctione of
words which did not by their accent counteract that natural sameness
of movemeut which we find undisguised in Alcaeus, λαῖφος δὲ πᾶν
(doulon ἤδη, etc. No quadrisyllabic ending or beginning is found in
Book iv except os the forms of ‘Nomen beati qui Deorum' aud
‘Consulque non nnius anni! Verses of the lorm of ‘ Gaudes, apricos
necte flores' (1. 26. 7) are found only in 1. 16, 26, 29, 35, and 2. 1,
3, 13, 14, 19. ‘Hunc Lesbio sacrare plectro' iu 1. 26. 11 is unique.
lt was the occurrence of these two verses iu 1. 26, and of the verse
‘Alcaee plectro dura navis' in 2. 13, that called Lachmann's attention
to the wrong date assigned by Franke, on Justinus' authority, to the
quarrel of Phraates and Tiridates and consequently to these Odes,
which thus became specimeus ol Hoyace's later instead of his earlier
handiwork‚ see Introd. to Books i·iii, § 8.

There is no synaphen between the verses of the stanna, but Horace
twice allows an elision of a hypermetric syllable at the end of the
third verse, 2. 3. 27 and 3. 29. 35. There is an analogous licence
taken in tlre Asclepiad metre in4. 1. 35, and Virgil allows it in the
hexameter, Georg. 1. 295, ete.

ξ 3. The Scppbz'c stanza is found in twenty-live Odes :—
1. 2, 10, ra, 2ο, 22, 25, 30, 32, 38 ς
2. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 163
3. 8, 11, 14, 18, 20, 22, 273

and iu the Carm. See.
It employs two kinds of werse, the lesser Sapphic, which is repeated
three times-

and the Adonic*

-υυ-Ξ.

The materials of the rhythnr in this are the sarne as in the Alcaio
Itis a sequence of trochees and dactyls. This is obscured in Horace,
(r) by his excluding the trochee absolutely from the second place,
where itis often found in Sappho, and in her first Latin inritator,
Catullus ni δὲ μὴ φιλεῖ ταχέως diaden, ‘Pauca nuntiate meae puellae ' 3
