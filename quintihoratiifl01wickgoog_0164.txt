LIB. ΙΙ. OD. 8.

'oon vrrr.

ιΝο, Barine, if you ever suffered in the least degree ior sorswearing yourself, Ι
would believe your oaths now; but you thrive on it, and only become more beau-
tiful and more popular. The gods who ought to punish you only laugh. Fresh
lovers crowd to you, and the old oues, in spite of your iaithlemnmspill not lor-
sake you'

ULLA si iuris tibi peierati
Poena, Barine, nocuisset unquam,
Dente si nigro fieres vel uno
κ Turpior ungui,
Crederem. Sed tu, simul obligasti
Perfidurn votis caput, enitescis
Pulchrior multo iuvenumque proriis
Publica cura.
Expedit matris cineres opertos '¹
Fallere et toto taciturna noctis ,

Ι Signa cum caelo gelidaque divos
Morte carentes

1-5. Dur. points out the art which
is expended in the collocation of this
stanza. The point is the contrast be·
tween the tiene he demands, brought
out by the emphatic position of ‘ulla'
‘unquam’ ‘dente’ ‘uno,' ‘ungui’ and
the lorge offer which he makes, brought
out by the single unqnalified ‘crederem’
the equivalent, in a single word, ior the
whole stanzaiul os offered conditione.
For a similarly balanced sentence, see
3· 3· 50·35·

1. iuris peierati, an expression ap·
parently coined by Horace sor a ‘false
or broken oath’ to follow the analogy
ol ‘iusiurandum' The Pseudo-Acron
vonches for the phrase ‘ius iuratum'
but it does not seem to be found any-
where.

5. uno, with ‘dente' as well as with
‘ungui' see on 1. a. 1.

4. turpior, in point of grammar. goes
with both ablativos, in point oi sense it
has more duty to discharge to that to
which it is attached. as ⁶ dente ' has its
special kind of deionnity named.

6. caput. From the habit of swear·
ing by the head, Virg. Aen. 9. 300, etc.
The ‘ vota’ are imprecations on herself
if her promises should not be kept.

7. iuvenum publica eura, ⁴ to break
the hearts oi all our youth’

prodis, ‘go abroad’ (Od. 3.14. 6),
to seek and win admiration.

9. expedit, sc. ‘tint' not a gene·
ralisptiou. ‘It¹ is positive gaiu to
you.

10. fallere, ‘to swear salsely by‚’ as
Virg. Aen. 6. 324 ‘Di cuius iurare
timent et fallere numen' For such
oaths tha commentatore compare Prop.
a. 20. 15 ‘Ossa tibi iuro per-matris et
ossa parentis; Si sallo, einis heu sit
mihi uterque gravis’; Virg. Aen. 6, 458
‘per sidera iuro, Per superos et si qua
fides tellure sub ima est?

taciturna, the epithet seems meant
to suggest the awfulness oi night, Epod.
5· 52· ,
11. gelida morte carentes, sc. ‘per
deos immortales! As they cannot die, it
is dangerous to swear salsely by them.
