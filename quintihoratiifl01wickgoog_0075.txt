HORATII CARMINUM

ODE XI.

‘Do not go to the Astrologers, Ieuconoe'. Better bearlife as it conres; enioy
the present, and think as little as possible about the future!

On the ‘mathematici' see Diei Ant. s. v. Astrologia3 ‘genus hominum potenti-
bus infidum sperantibus fallar quod in civitate nostra et vetabitur semper et
retinebitur,' Tac. Hist. r. 22. Horace himself was not above an interest in the
superstition oi the day, see Od. 2, 17, and Sat. 1. 6. 113. ,

The name of Leuconoe is chosen doubtless in portat least as a pretty sounding
name which suits the Choriambic mehe, as Neobule and Liparaeus suit the
Ionio a minore oi Od. 5. ra. It is possible also that Horace may have looked to
its etymology, but it is hard for us to say whether it would hare conveyed a corn-
plimentary sense or the reverser ‘candida' or ‘clara mente' say some oi his
editors ‘empty-miuded’ say others. Pindar’s λευκαὶ φρένες, Pyth. 4. 194, which is
quoted in support of the latter vieW, seems rather to imply ‘malignity’ than
‘solly.'

TU ne quaesieris scire nefas, quern mihi, quem tibi
Finem di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios
Tentaris numeros Ut melius, quidquid erit, pati!

Seu plures hiemes seu tribuit Iuppiter ultimam,

Quae nunc oppositis debilitat pumicibus mare 5
Tyrrhenum, sapiam, vina liques, et spatio brevi

Spem longam reseces Dum loquimur, sugerit invida
Aetas: carpe diem quam minimum credula postero

1. tu, see on Od. 1.9. 16. The use
oi the pronoun emphasizes the prayer,
‘Pray do not.’

quaesieris, Madv. ξ 386. The
perf. subj. is more usual thau the pres,
subj. or imperative in prohibitions ad-
dressed to the second person. ‘Hoc
sacit03 hoc ne seceris: Cic. Div. a.
61.

3. numeros, ‘tables’ ‘calculatione'
Juv. 6. 576. Cic. Div. 2. 47 ‘rationes
Chaldaeas.’

ut melius, ὅσῳ βέλτιον, ‘How
much better is itl’ so in prose, Cic.
Mil. ²4 ‘Ut contempsit ac pro nihilo
putavit,’ etc.

4. seu . . seu. lt isa question whe-
ther the epodosis is to be looked for in
‘ut melius,‘ etc, or in ‘sapias’ Orelli
prefers the latter, as aroiding arr awk-
ward break in the run oi v. 6.

5. debilitat, breaks the soree of,

beats tlpe waves on the rocks till they
are tire .

pumicibus, of any rocks ¹ vesco sale

i. sapias, od. 1. 7. 17.

liques, ‘ clear! This was dorre either
with a lineo stratum, or by other means,
such as those described in Sat. a. 4. 55.

sparto brevi, ‘by the thought of the
little span os lite!

7. dum loquimur, imitated by Pers.
5. 155 ‘Vive memor leti: fugit hora3
hoc quod loquor inde est.²

8. carpe diem. What is the meta-
phor? is it of plucking a flower?
‘Velox Flosculus angustae miseraeque
brevissima vitae Portio‚' Juv. 9. rr6; or
perhaps rather (as Orelli) ‘match'
ἅρπαζε, ‘fugitivo gandia carpe,' Mart. 7.
ph7. 11, ‘’catch them by the sleere as

ey run.
