HORATH

EPODON

Labuntur altis interim rivis aquae,
Queruntur in silvis aves,

Fontesque lymphis obstrepunt manantibus,
Somnos quod invitet leves

At cum tonantis annus hibernus Iovis
Imbres nivesque comparat,

Aut trudit acres hinc et hinc multa cane
Apros in obstantes plagas

Aut amite levi rara tendit retia,
Turdis edacibus dolos

Pavidumque leporem et advenam laqueo gruem 55
Iucunda captat praemia.

Quis non malarum, quas amor curas habet,
Haec inter obliviscitur?

25. rivis, the reading of V and B;
though corrected in the latter byasecond
hand to ‘ripis' thereadiugof the maJority
of MSS. Compare against Orelli's objec-
tions to 'rivis,’ Od. a. 3.11. ‘Altis rivis’
must apparently mean ‘in brimming
watercourses': ‘altis ripis' has been
variously rendered; Bentley, who pre-
fers it on the ground that we are speak-
ing of summer or autumn when streams
are low, iuterprets ‘with their banks
high: i.e. ‘deep between their banks.¹
Orelli thinks it is not meant as a pecu-
liarity oi the time of year, but asa
general characteristic of the streams
which adds to their beauty and plea-
santness, ‘between high banks,’ i. e. os
foliage, rocks, etc. But a comparison
of Lucr. 2. 362 (in the same connection
as this) ‘summis labentia ripis‚’ and
Quint. 12. 2 ‘Ut vis amnium maior est
altis ripis multoque gurgitis tractu flu·
entium quam tenuis aquae et obiectu
lapillorum resultantis’ would suggest
that if Horace wrote ‘altis ripis' he
meant rather ‘high up its banks,¹ so
that it comes to the same as ‘rivis’

27. obstrepunt, sc. ‘audientibus' see
Od. 3. 30. 10. Markland founded on
Prop. 4. 4. 4 ‘Multaque nativis obstrepit
'orbor aquis,¹ an ingeniousconj. ⁵ frondes’

for ‘fontes’ ‘lymphis' being then the¹

dative.
28. quod, se. 'murmur quod?

rot-56. We pass to winter amuse-
men s.

29. tonantis, an epithet ol the

god which has become almost a part
of his ¹namer but it serves to recall
his influence on the weather and re·
sponsibility for storms although thun-
deris rather an accessory of summer
storms.

annus hibernae, the wintry part of
the year, as ‘frigidus annus’ Virg. Aen. ¹
6. 311. ‘Jove’s winter' is the winter
which in its season Jove brings round
again. C. S. 52 ‘Iovis aurae?

3²· obstantes, ‘set to stop them'

35. levi, prob. ‘smooth’ though as
‘ames' does not occur elsewhere in
poetry, it is not possible to pronounce
certainly on the quantity of its first
syllable.

rara, ‘ opem’ ‘wide-meshed,’ see Con.
on Virg. Aen. 4. 131. Tire epitheta
though, as has been remarked, more
abundant than Horace's maturet taste
would have admitted, serve, by recalling
the circumstances io recall the pleasures
ol the sport.

55, laqueo, a dissyllable, not an
anapaest, cp. Epod. 5. 79, 11. 23, and
see Index of Matres.

57 foll. The ‘malae amoris curae‚’ its
sollies and fancies and J'ealousies are left
for the idle and luxurious lise ol the
city. The ‘pudica uxor’ and the plea-
sures os home are more likely to be
found in the country. Virg. G. 2. 523
‘dulces pendent circum oscula nati3
Casta pudicitiam servat domus.' For
the attractiou which makes ‘curas'
agree with the relative, and leaves
