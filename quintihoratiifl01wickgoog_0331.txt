HORATII CARMINUM

Iudex honestum praetulit utili,
Reiecit alto dona nocentium
Voltu, per obstantes catervas
Explicuit sua victor arma.
Non possidentem multa vocaveris
Recte beatum: rectius occupat
Nomen beati, qui deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti
Duramque callet pauperiem pati
Peiusque leto flagitium timet,
Non ille pro caris amicis
Aut patria timidus perire.

only, but always) There is no difficulty,
so far, in the substantives, ‘vindan’
‘consui’ as applied to ‘animus' and
not to the marr himself ; no more 'than in
'the passage just quoted, where 'virtue'
= ‘thevirtuous man,' is said to be always
consul. Bentley has collected a number
¹of similar instantes from all Latinity;
‘animus lucis contemptor,’ Virg. Aen.
·9. 205, ‘animus liberator,’ ‘carnifern’
‘proscripton' etc. But the expression
becomes harsb and embarrassed when
the mind is said to be a ⁴ consul of more
than one year‚' by virtue of its behaviour
as a judge. Ritter 'thinks that this was
sostened bya consciousness in the poet
and his readers ofthe current etymology
of ⁴ consul ’ as =‘qui hene consulit‚’Varr.
L. L. 5. 80. Ar any rate tlte harsh·
ness is sostened by the distance of the
words from ‘animus' With ‘consul'
we take up the notion of Lollius, him·
seli the ert-consul, and cease to feel
tlyay¹ we are speaking of his mind, not
o rm.

40-44. sed quoties . . arma. ‘Sed
quoties¹ answering to ‘non unius anni,’
‘consul‚ not of one year, but in per·
petuity, so osten as,’ ete, ‘quoties’ being
understood before the second and third
clauses. Orelli compares 3. 24. 40 foll.
where ‘si,' and 4. 8. 31 foll. where ‘sia’
are similarly omitted. Of the Scholiasts
Porph. alone takes the stanna in adiffer·
ent way, making ‘explicuit . . victor’ the
apodosis to ‘quoties iudex. . praetulit..

reiecit) ‘So often as on the Judgment·
seat it resists the temptations of expe·
diency and bribery, it is a conqueror as
much as if it were scattering foemen in
real battle! The construction is not
any eas'ier, and the flow of the lines is
less easy, than ii ‘ sed quoties’ gave at
once the full antithesis to ‘non unius
anni,' and started us on a fresh thought;
but Porph. seems to be followed, among
recent editors, if we may judge irom their
punctuation, by Keller and Mt. Munro.
The question is partly mixed up with
the further doubt asto the reference of
the whole stanna. Porph.'s construction
is only admissible on the view (which
Orelli supports) that it refers entirely to
Lollius' civilitatis conduct asa ‘iudex
selectus’ (Sat. 1. 4. 123), the last two
lines being metaphorical. It must be
allowed, however, that under the cir·
cumstances of Lollius, and seeing how
lightly his military exploits would in
that case be passed over, it would be a
somewhat double·edged compliment to
speak of him as ‘a great conqueror,'
with the tacit addition of ‘metaphor-
ically and in a moral sense?

44. explicuit, much like ‘expedivit'
‘has carried safely through! Livy has
‘explicare fugam? 1. 50.

45 to end. A picture of the ideal
‘wise man'3 cp. a. r. 17. Horace at
once holds it out for Lollius' own con·
templation, and suggests to his calum-
niators, that such had been Lollius’ real
bearing in his province.
