Acron’s statement, ‘Stesichorum imitatur,’ can barely mean'nrore than that
Horace took from him the idea oi a ‘palinode’ Ritter suggests that the first
line may be an echo of some line in which Stesichorus addressed Helen as fairer

than her mother Leda.

O MATRE pulchra filia pulchrior,
Quem criminosis cunque voles modum
Pones iambis sive flamma
Sive mari libet Hadriano
Non Dindymene, non adytis quatit
Mentem sacerdotum incola Pythius,
Non Liberaeque, non acuta
Sic geminant Corybantes aera,
Tristes ut irae, quas neque Noricus

a. modum pones, ‘modum ponere,’
‘to set bounds,’ ‘cupidinibus orationi‚'
etc, are common expressione, cp Od.
3. 15. a ‘nequitiae fige modum! There
is a play in its extension here to mean
simply ⁵ to put an end to,’ i. e. ‘destroy.'
The verses have been intemperate, the
lady shall put bounds to thern in the
only possible way. Compare Ovid's
trope, {Emendaturis ignibus,’ Trist.
4. ro. 2.

5. nones, the permissive future, ‘you
shall is you wish,’ see on Od. 1. 6. 1.

4. Hadriano, see on Od. 1. r. 14.

5-9. ‘Ira furor brevis est! ‘No di·
vine afflatus makes those it possesses so
reckless as the passion oi anger.’

5. Dindymene, ‘Dea Dindymi,’ Cat.

. 62. 91, a mountain in Phrygia where
Cybele was worshipped.

non adytis. .inoola Pythius. lt
seems hest to take this as a slight inver-
sion, aiter Horace’s manner, ior ‘adytis
Pythiis incola: ‘not in his shrine at
Pytho the god who dwells there ’ς comp.
Epod. 10. 12 ‘Graia victorum manus'
for the · more usual ‘Graiorum' For
the mode of describing the god, comp.
Virg. Aen. 3. 111 ‘mater cultrix Cy·
belae? Possibly ‘incola’ may have a
stronger force, and represent Pindar's
οὐκ crotopus τυχών (Pyrh. 4. 7), ‘when
his presence is there'; with reference to
the migrations os gods irorn one shrine
to another. Dillenburger’s interpreta-
tion is less likely. He takes ‘sacer-
dotnm'dad rorvori,with ‘incola' as well
as with ‘mentem’ ‘his priests' hearts
when he possesses them‚' quoting Plu·

tarch de Orac. Des. p. 414 e, riv θεὸν,
αὐτὸν . . ἐνδυόμενον ris vti σώματα τῶν ¹
προφητῶν ὑποφθέγγεσθαι. ’

adytis is opposed to the more widely
diffused afflatus, ἐνθουσιασμός, of Cybele
or Bacchus.

7-8. non acuta sio . . uera, ‘the
Corybantes do not clash again their
cymbals with such iury? Grammati-
cally, these words are in a parenthesis,
putting in another form what we have
already had ot the priests oi Cybele:
and the main construction harmonicas
not with thern but with the other
clauses. ‘Non Dindymene . .non Apollo
..non Liberaeque quatiunt mentem ..
tristes ut irae’ Bentley, offended at the
anacoluthon, proposed to read ‘si' sor
‘sio' constructing as Od. 2. 17. 13 ⁶ Me
nec Chimaerae spiritus igneae Nec si
resurgat centimanus Gyas Divellet un·
quarn.¹ ‘Not the Corybantes if they

clash again* etc. His reading is ac·
cepted by Keller, Dillr, and others,

but in addition to the fact that only the
slightest MS. authority can be obtained
ior it, there is tbe objection that it will
introduce an entirely new idea, viz. tbe
effect of the Corybantian cymbals on the
hearers, instead of what we bave in the
rest os the stanza, the effect of the divine
afflatus on the ἔνθεοι themselves; and as
the second-hand inspiration will be the
nealcen the result is an anticlimax.

9. tristes ‘ ill-omenes} ¹ odious’ .

irae, ‘bursts of passion.¹

Noricus, Epod. 17. 71. Noricum, the
modern Tyrol‚ Styria, Corinthia, was
sarnous for its iron, Ptin. N. H. 54. 41.
