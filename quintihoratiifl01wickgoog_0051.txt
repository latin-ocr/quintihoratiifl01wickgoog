HORATII CARMINUM

ODE ll.

‘Wn have seen and felt enough ol the wrath ol the gods, Our populationis
thlnned by civil war, while the Parthians dely us in safety. What god can save
our falling empire, or atone lor our guilt 1 Apollo? Venus? our father Marsi nay
rather Mercury, who is amongst us in human shapc, and submitting to be called
Caesar's ataugei—you, Augustus, you must bc our prince. Long may you live-
stay the civil war, aad chastise the Parthians l’

This is one of the Odes which seem to challenge us by the definiteness oi their
historical allusions to find their date, and which yet baffle us il we attempt to do
so. That the portenta referred to in vv. 1-20 are those which followed the death
ol Julius Caesar, ac. 44 (Dio C. 45. 17, Virg. G. 1.466 loll.. Tib. 2. 5. 71 foll,
Ον. Met. 15. 782 loll), seems certain from vv. 18. 44, although Horace stands
alone in mentioning the inundation of the Tiber‚ Dio and Virgil only speaking os
the Po. That the Ode was not written at that time is still more certain. Augustus
did not then occupy the whole horizon of politice. Horace was at Athens, and
on the point oi joining the army oi Brutus. Franke places its composition in rac.
29, when Augustus returned to Rome aiter the victory othelium, and celebrated
his threelold triumph (see ν. 49). Dio (53. 4) malres Augustus asseri that his
mission had been τῷ πατρὶ δεινῶν σφαγέντι τιμωρῆσαι as well as τὴν πόλιν ἐν μεγά-
λων rai ἐπαλλήλων κακῶν ἐξελέσθαι. And the temple of Mars Ultor, of which the
sayade probably still stands, in the forum of Augustus, was built in fullilment of a
vow made hy him, ‘ bello Philippensi pro ultione paterna suscepto‚’ Suet. Oetav.
293 cp. Ον. Fast. 5. 569. If Horace identifies lor a moment the ‘scelus expian-
dum' with the death os Caesar, his thoughts at least are not running on any cruel
vergeance when he sees in the avenger the incarnation of‘ gentle Maia's son,' the
god of peacelul arta, osprudence aad persuasiou‚ oi commerce and wealth.

Compare with the whole poem Virg. G. 1. 466 to the end—a complete parallel
both in sentiment and expression.
