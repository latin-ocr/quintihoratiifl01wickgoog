HORATII CARMINUM

ODE VII.

‘Seniue has returned to earth, and with it foliage and light and warmth. It will
not last sor ever: this is the lesson of revolving seasons. Only tley pass to return
agaim we, when we pass where the great and good are gone before us, are dust
and nothing. To·day may be your last; who knowsl Take your fill of enjoy-
ment. What you spend on yourself is at least so much the less for your grecdy
heir. When once you are dead and passed Minos' grand tribunal, neither race,
Torquatus, nor eloquence‚ nor goodness, will restore you to the light. Think of
Hippolytus and Pirithous, and leam this lesson from their fate!

Torquatus is the same person, doubtless‚ whom Horace addressed in Epp. 1. 5,
to much the same purpose as in this Ode; but more than that it is difficult to say,
notwithstanding the many guesscs that have been offered on the subject. The two
most plausible ones are‚w(1) that of Estre, who identifies with him the Aulus Tor·
quatus mentioned in Corn. Nep. Atticus, as amongst those who were compromised
by their share in Brutus and Cassius’ campaign. This would give an occasion for
Horace's acquaintance with him, though the prominence which is given to him
will hardly suit a man of Horace's own age or rank. (a) That of Weichert‚ who
thinks that he was no member of the Manlia gens, but the C. Nonius Asprenas
mentioned by Suetonius (Aug. 43 and 56), the intimate friend of Augustus⁵ who
had assumed for himself and his family the cognomen of Torquatus by pennission
of the emperor, and in memory of a golden ‘torques’ with which Augustus had
presented him on the occasion of his injuring himself by a fall while performing
in the Ludus Troiae. His assumption os the name has been held to prove, what
there are no other facts to disprove, that the old family of Torquati was extinct.

The Ode is remarkably parallel to 1. 4 ; ao much so, that Macleane is inclined
to think that it was omitted on this account from the first three Books‚ and only
publishcd under the necessity of making up a respectable number to meet Augustus'
requirement of a fourth Book. There is nothing to indicate its date.

DIFFUGERE nivea, redeunt iam gramina campis
Arboribusque comae;

Mutat terra vices et decrescentia ripas
Flumina praetereunt;

1. diffugere, ‘like an army defeated? complete changewhich that orderly suc-
as Wordsworth paraphrases it. cession is at this moment bringing about.

3. mutat vices=‘mutationem an· terra is probably the ‘dry land‚’ in
uuam patitur'; ‘vice annua' (cp. ‘grata which ease ‘mutat terra vices' sums up
vice veris’ 1. 4. 1, ‘benigna vice‚' Epod. the changes of the two preceding linea,
13. 8) ‘mutatur‚' ‘is passing its orderly as the next line and a half deal with the
change! ‘Mutat conditionem' would ‘streame'
not express the ordarly successim of the 4. praetereunt, ‘tlow past (te.
conditions. ‘Vices patitun’ ‘peragit,’ within) their banha’ instead of pour-
Ov. Met. 15. 258, wosdd not express the ing over them.
