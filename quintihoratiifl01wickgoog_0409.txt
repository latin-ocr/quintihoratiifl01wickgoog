of the name to a special character, as ‘Cyrus’ 1. 17. 25, r. 33.
» 6; ‘Pholoe' 1. 33, 7, 9, 2. 5. 17, 3.15. 73 ‘Telephus' 1. 13.
1, 3. 19. 26, 4. 11. 21 ; ‘Lyce' 3. 10, 2011 4. 13; 1101 this last
instance (viewedin light of the general relation of Book iv. 10 the
earlier Books) points to the explanation that it is in all cases a
literary identity‚ a reminiscerce of aprevious poem, 00101 aliving
person. On the other hand, the same‘narne is at times given
to people 01 such different characters or ages, that those who 0100111
give thern real existence are· obliged to recognise more than one owner
01 the 112012; cp. the Phyllis 01 2. 420114. 11,1110 Chloris 01 25
21111 3. 15, the Lalage 01 1. 22 2011 2. 5, not 10 say the Glycera
0113021111 1. 33. There are cases, doubtless, where a reality is
given to unknown names by their being brought into close relation
with real persons and events, such as ‘Mystes' the lost friend of
Valgius in 2. 9; ‘Damalis' who 12 10 rival Bassus in draughts 01
wine at the feast on Numida's return, 1. 36 ; ‘Glycera' to whom
Tibullus is supposed 10 write piteous elegies, 1. 33. In this last case
we note that Glycera is not a name that occurs in Tibullus' extant
elegieS, which suggests the possibility that even in such instances as
these, though the reference be real, the name may be fictitious. This
is of course the ultimate refuge of those who would see in the heroines
01 1112 01102 1021 persons. The names they give up; but Horace, it ’
12 argued, may have concealed the true 021002, 22 tradition tells us
(200 212 1011011.) Catullus concealed the name 01 Clodia under that
of Lesbia, Propertius that of Hostia under that 01 Cynthia, Tibullus
that of Plania under that 01 Delia, etc.; and Horace himself, in the
Epodes and Satires, the name of Gratidia under that 01 Canidia3
it 12 0100 added (see 111111.) the name of Terentia, hlaecenas' wife,
under that 01 Licymnia. The possibility cannot be 11201011, but the
suggestion leaves us much where we were as 10 any canon by which

to know true persons from imaginary ones. No tradition helps 02, ’

2011 Estre observes that the only instances of such concealmentof
real names for which any tradition vouches are instances 0110101110
1100 and false names were metrically equivalent, a requirement which
malres havoc of several schemes of ‘amores Horatiani' We should
still have to leave as the representatives of different persons names
which suit almost every metrical 1001 01 1110, three, or 1001
syllables.

There is one unlrnown name in the 01102, that 01 Cinara (Od. 4.
1. 4, 4. 13. 21, 22, Epp. 1. 7, 28, 1. 14. 33), which is perhaps
1010010011 from this shadowy existence, both by the persona] feelings
