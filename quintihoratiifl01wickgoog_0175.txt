HORATII CARMINUM

O DE XIII.

Tim thoughts suggested by the fall ofa tree on his Sabine sarm from which
Horace narrowly escaped. For other allusions to the incident see Od. a. 17. 27,
3. 4. 27, 3. 8. 8 ; and on the date ol all the Odes which refer to it see Introd. to
Books i--iii, ς 8.

The poem begins with a burst of indignation, at least half humorous (comp.
Epod. 3), at the nnlucky tree and the wretch that planted it. Then, from the
mention (v. ra) of the accident that had so nearly overwhelmed him, rises the
thought, ‘How little we gness the quarter from which danger really threatens us.
We fix our eyes on some one risk and sear that only, but death conres to all the
world from the quarter they do not expect) Nen, suggested by the ‘leti Vis
rapuit rapietque,’ comes the remembrance how very near to death he has been,
“how near seeing Proserpine and Aeacus on his seat of judgment and the separate
abode of happy souis, among them' (here comes the last change) ‘those whom the·
lyrIc poet would first look lor, Sappho and Alcaeus. An admiring throng of
shades is round both, but the larger and the more attentive round Alcaeus. What
wonder if they listen, when even Cerberus is spen-bound, and Prometheus and
Tantalus forget their pains, and Orion stays sronr his hunting to hear.'

1. ilie et. .primum. The object lore equally ‘nefasti’3 bur by an error
of Horace's indignation Is the man that which A. Gellius notices (Noct. Art.
planted the trec, so that ‘ille’ stands 4. 9), the epithet was vulgarly restrIcted
fitly in the place of emphasis in both to those which were interdicted sor
stanzas. ‘Quicunque primum' has in· business as ‘tristi omine infames* In

from its age), bntI can tell for certain 2. sacrilega, generalised as often:
the character both of the man and of ‘impious’
the day of his deed.’ The alteration to 3. produxit, ‘reared' :-the verb is
‘illum' (‘ illum et‚' Heins.; ‘illum o‚' used os educating children in Juv. 14.

relative with ‘quicunque’ sor its subject, and only the vehicle for the second idea,
‘illum' only anticipating the next which is to he lookedsorin ‘sacrilega
