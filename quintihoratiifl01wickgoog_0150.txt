LIB. 11.

OD. a.

Gadibus iungas et uterque Poenus
⁵ Serviat uni. ’

Crescit indulgens sibi ‘dirus hydropa,

Nec sitim pellit, nisi causa morbi

Fugerit venis et aquosus albo
Corpore languor. Ι

Redditum Cyri solio Phraaten ,

Dissidens plebi numero beatorum μ

Eximit Virtus, populumque falsis ,
Dedocet uti

Vocibus, regnum et diadema tutum

Deferens uni propriamque laurum,

Quisquis ingentes oculo inretorto,
Spectat acervos.

11. et, ‘and so! Ditlr. draws atterr-
tiou to the consecutive force of ‘et‚' as
almost equal to ‘ita ut.¹ Cp. 1. 3. 8,

.15. 10.
4 15. indulgens sibi, ‘by indulging
itsels: ie. its own severish thirst.

hydrops, ‘the dropsy.’ It is pro·
perly the subject of ‘crescit’ but it is
made also the subject oi ‘indulgens’
and ‘pellit’ the actions oi the sick man
being attributed to his malady.

14. nee sitim. . languor, ‘drinking
increases the disease; it cannot quench
the thirst till the malady which causes
the thirst is gone, and with it the other
symptoms.’ The application ol the
analogy is evident. Cp. 3. 16. 17 ‘Cre-
scentem sequitur cura pecuniam Maior-
umque fames! Ovid reproduces the
comparison, Fast. 1. 212 ‘quum possi-
deant plurima plura petuntr Sic quibus
intumuit suffusa uenter abunda Quo pius
sunt potae plus sitiuntur aquae.'

nisi . . venis. They speak os drink-
ing as though it immediately filled the
vcins, Sat. 2. 4. 2 5 ‘vacuis committere
venis Nil nisi lene dccet’; oi thirst as

though it were deit in the teins, Virg. G

3. 482 ‘renis omnihus acta sitis.' So
the meaning is, ‘no pouring into the
veins will cure the thirst; there is some·
thing that must be got rid of out ol
them-some inner malady iu the re·
cesses ol the body!

15. aquosus languor, ‘the laintness
caused by the water.'

17. redditum Gyri solio, cp. 5. 29.
27 ‘regnata Cyro Bactra! It is the most
distinct enunciation of that identity of
the Parthian with the Persian monarchy =
which Horace assumes elsewhere. See
on Od. 1. 2. η. For the historical event
referred to see Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 8.

19. Virtus, thejudgment oi avirtuous
man, as in Satcr. 5. 42.

20. dedocet, ‘would sain unteach
the pcople to use names falsely.’

ar, 22. tutum, propriam, predica·
tive, a diadem and a laurel ctown that
cannot be taken away again. Cp. 3. 2.
17-20.

23. oculo inretorto, ‘who can see
hage treasureheaps, and never turn to
look again!
