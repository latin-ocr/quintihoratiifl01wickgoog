‘Hi-:nore exploits require a Homer to sing of them,' says Horace, and so gives
Agrippa the lyric glory that (it would seem) he has asked for, while professing to
leave the tasi< os celebrating such exploits to the epic genius of Varius For
panegyric cast in the same torm compare Od. a. 12 and 4. 2. ,

The Ode is addressed to M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the friend and counsellor of
Augustus, and the greatest commender of his reign. He finally defeated Sextus
Pompeius at Naulochus in Bc. 56, and commanded at Actium in nc. 51. After
the death os Marcellus (and consequently, it would seem, alter the publication of
this Ode) he was married by Augustus to his daughter Julia (nc. ar); was asso-
ciated with him (ra-c, 18) in the Tribunitian power, and was looked upon as his
intended successor. He died four years before Horace, in rac. 12. Horace speaks
of his popularityin Sat. 2. 3. 185 ; of his subjugation oi the Cantabri in Epp. 1. 12.
26; ol his engineering exploit of turning the Lucrine lake into a harbour, though
without mentioning his name, in A. P. 63.

1. scriberis. Not necessarily adefi-
nite promise or prophecy,-although
Varius is said really to have written a
‘Panegyricus in Caesarem Octavianum’
(see Epp. r. 16. 27, where Horace is said
by the Schol. to have borrowed ag lines
from that poem) which would have
contained the exploits of Agrippa-but

to write of you.'‚ Cp. Od, 1. 7. 1 ⁶ lauda-

2. Maeonii carminis, Od. 4. q. 5,
‘Homeric’; cp. Sat. 1. 10. 44 ‘Forte
epos acer Ut nemo Varius ducit)

’ alite. This is the unanimous read-
tttttlaltiutt initialis
difficulty of the ablative made them
separate it from ‘Vario' and explain it
by ‘Homericis auspiciis.' Ritter takes
‘Vario ’ as a dative, and ‘ali e' as a loose
‘ad sensum' apposition to it. lt seems
better with Orelli to take ‘Vario . . alite’
as an abl. absol, a construction the use
os which Horace is inclined to extend

(see Od. a.1.12,16.2.7.r5‚3. 5.5). The
position of the words is quite in his man-
ner; the promise or permission standing
first, and accompanied only by Varius'
name as a sufficient guarantee to stay in
initio any impatience; then, measured
off against each other, the characteristics
of the theme and oi the poet who is fit
to sing oi it. ‘lt shall be told, but by
Varius, thy bravery and ffly victories,
for he is a bird of Maeonian soug.'
For the grammatica} difficulty of the
separation of ‘Vario' from ‘alite' we
may perhaps compare Sat. 1. 3. 70 ‘ Cum
mea compenset uitiis bona,' if ‘curn’
be there a preposition. For more certain
but rather less analogous cases of odd
sorting of words see Sat. a. 1.' 60; a. 3.
a. 11. The passages usually quoted on
this place, such as (os Horace) Sat. a. 1.
84 ⁸ Iudice laudatus Caesare '; Epp. 1. r.
94 ‘curatus inaequali tonsore,’ are in-
sufficient to substantiale the use of the
ablativa of the agent without a preposi-
tion. There is either a predicate pre·
sent, as in ‘iudice Caesare’ (Dillenburger
quotes it as ‘laudatus Caesare,’ which
would be just the ease we are in search
os), which brings it within the scope of
the abl. absol, or else the subst. is
barely personal, and the abl. becomes
rather instrumental or modal, asin Or.
