may sing of Augustus returning in triumph withthe Sygambri at his
chariot wheelS, and of the people's joy. It may be, in the rapture
of that happy day, even he too may lind a voice and sing his best, and
shout with the shouting people, and make his humble oilerings.² nno
yet-the tone changes in Ode 3-ahe remembers that ‘he is a poet,
set apart from his birth by the Muse from common ambitions and
’ glorier, recognised as such by the-voice of Rome ; and s0, though all
the glory is the Muses, not his own, he will venture, and somewhat
loudly sweep the string’

’ 3. The middle of the Book is occupied with the expansion ol the
sarne theme as that oi Ode gale only therne besides the triumphs
and blessings of the empire which seems to wake ¹him to any of his
old lyric fire, the conseio'usness of his own poetic power, and the
immortality which he can confer on others as he has secured it for
himself ¹. Odes -6, 8, 9, like Ode 3, while they express Horace's
inmost feelings, lead also directly to the main purpose of the Book.
In his own words he gives Augustus the panegyric ior which he had
asked, and ‘pretium dicit muneri! They are divided by Ode 117,
which enforces the lesson that no other immortality must be looked
for; high blood, eloquence‚ piety‚ are alike powerless to save from
the ending of all mortality-a handful ol dost and a shadow. They
are followed by the Ode to Ligurinas a forced tribute to the professione
of Ode 1, and with reference to it. Then he finds a place not too
conspicuous sor his private friendship for Maecenas. Two more
Odes in his old character as a poet oswine and of love, the second
manifestly a companion and sequel to an Ode of Book iii, complete
what he thinks necessary to give the reliel of variety, and he returns
to Tiberius' victory andwhat he values more, the domestic peace of
Augustus' reign.
