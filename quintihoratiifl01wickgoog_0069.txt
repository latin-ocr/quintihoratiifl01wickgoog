HORATII CARMINUM

Certus enim promisit Apollo

Ambiguam tellure nova Salamina futuram. ,
O fortes peioraque passi

Mecum saepe viri, nunc vino pellite curas;
Cras ingens iterabimus aequor.

‘Auspex' is used elsewhere either of the
person who attende the imperator and
actually takes the auspices, or ii in the
sense ol ‘patron' then only of some
god who by omens o'r otherwise sanc-
tions an enterprise. Meanwhile a cer-
tain amount of doubt hangs over the
reading. Paris A, with a lew other
MSS, has ⁸ auspice Teucri,' and Acron's
note looks as if he had found that read·
ing auspice. Fautore vel suasore, Apol·
linem dicit cuius responsa vel promissa
sequebatur.' Victorinus (fourth cen-
tury), who is quoted in defence os the
vulg„ gives no support to it. Hc only
quotes the line forits mette, and two
of the best MSS. of his work read
‘Teucri' Keller accepts that reading.
It must then mean ‘under the guidance
of Teucer aad ol Teucer's patron,’ sc.
Apollo; but ‘ auspex’ in this sense with
a genitive of the person patronized is
unlikety, and the combination ⁶ duce ..
auspice' is harsh. Bentley reads ex
couj. ‘Phoebo’ which would satisfy

Acron’s note, though not so probably

as ‘Teucri’ The slight variation of
a technical phrase, which is the main
ground on which Bentley opposed the
vulg, is really quite in Horace’s manner,
sce on Od. 3. 5. 4²·

more soree to the dreariness ol ‘ingens'
than to suppose that they had lauded
sor the night in their flight, see on v. 2 3.
