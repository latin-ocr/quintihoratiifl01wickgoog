O D E XXXIV.

· ‘I ecmannus my old Epicurean doctrine of the -“ careless'' gods (Sat. 1. 5. 101).
l have heard thunder not where Lucretius might explain itte me from clashing
clouds, botin a elcudless sky, where Ieould not but recognise if as the rolling of
the chariot wheels that shake all creation. lt is the same hand that launches
“bolts from a clear sky’‘ inhuman things, thattins the humhle and overthrows
the proud when men least expect it!

Horace is thinking probably of the challenge with -whiehLucretius clenches his
argument that thunder comes from purely natural causes :— ’

‘Denique cur nunquam caelo iacit undique puro
,luppiter in terras fulmen sonitusque profundit?’—6. 400.

The notable changes of fortune in his mind at the time are very possibly the vicissi-
tudes of Phraates and Tiridates on the Parthian throne (seelntrod. to Odes i-iii, ᾗ 8),
though the expressions ¹-in vv. 14 foll. are not particular enough to necessitate this
interpretation. The frameworlr of the Ode bears some‘resemblanee to that of
1. eat each center-ing round a circumstance in the poet's personal experience. This
in both cases stands hr the middle of the Ode, introduced by the emphatic
‘namque’ (1. 22. 9): it isthe ground of the statements that precede arrd follow.
What he has witnessed in this case, and thecause to which alone he can trace it,
justify both the general recantatien of stanza 1, and the solution which he gives in
stanza 4 of the difficulty in the human world which seems to him analogous to
the theoder, for which no ‘secondary cause' was te be found, in the material
world.
