252 HORATH canumuiu

Plerumque gratae divitibus vices
Mundaeque parvo sub lare pauperum ,
Coenae sine aulaeis et ostro
Sollicitam explicuere frontem.
Iam clarus occultum Andromedae pater
Ostendit ignem, iarn Procyon furit
Et stella vesani Leonis
Sole dies referente siccos:
Iam pastor umbras cum grege¹ languido
Riyumque fessus quaerit et horridi
Dumeta Silvani, caretque
Ripa vagis taciturna ventis ,
Tu, civitatem quis deceat statua,
Curae, et Urbi sollicitus timeS,
Quid Seres et regnata Cyro
Bactra parent Tanaisque discors.
