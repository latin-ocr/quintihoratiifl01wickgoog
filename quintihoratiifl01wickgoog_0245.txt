ODE XIV.

Wnrrrmr 011 the return of Augustus, in no. 24, from his campaign in Spain, the

, last few months 01 which he had spent in sickness at Tarraco. The Ode is not in

Horace's best manner. It may be compared for its subject with 4. a and 5.

‘Caesar is coming back a conqueror, like Hercules, srom his dangerous expedi-
tion to Spain. Prepare a public “ supplicatio.” His wife Livia. his sister Octavia,
mothers who are recovering their sons-in-law or sons, the sons themselves and
their young wives all have their parts to play. Ishall keep my private holiday

should not have been so easy seventeen years ago!

With the end 01 the Ode compare that 01 1. 36 and a. 11. The point 01 the
last stanzas lies in the words ‘eximet curas,’ v. 14. The reason is given and then

’ the feeling is exemplified.
