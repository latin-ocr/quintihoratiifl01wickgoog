antecedent to the composition. But if this difference must make us
cautious in drawing sweeping conclusione as to the other Books from
the obviously conscious and artistic arrangement1 of Book iv, we may
at least gather that Horace contemplated a collection of poenas being ¹
read continuously in such away that the effect of a particular poem
could be heightened or weakened by the sequence in 'which it was
placed3 and we may leam something also of the principles of taste
which would be likely to gulde him in arranging other collectione.

3. A marked feature of Horace's style is the irony· with which he
professes to shrink from enthusiasm, to be the poet of mirth and love,
‘non praeter solitum levis' surprised, it may be, occasionally into
serious subjecte, but recovering himself before he has done injury
to a theme for which he is unfitt Itis this irony as much as the
mere desire for variety that makes him scatter his political poems at
such wide intervals. It is this, as we shall see, that colours the pre-
lude to Book iv3 and though the relation between 1. 1 and r. a is not
worked out so fully as that between 4. 1, 2, 3 and 4. 4, 5, it is substan-
tiully the same. Od. 1. 1 has of course arelationto the whole three
Books; but it is not an accident that a poem, in which his political
saith is set forth most fully, should follow immediately on his opening
apology for werse-writing as a taste not more unaccountable than the
thousand others that divide mankind.

On its artistic side,--that is where it affects his manner as a
principle of taste, rather than as a characteristic of his oum feelings or
aprudential consideration of the jndgment of the world,-this irony
is nearly connected with another feature of his style which will be ’
noticed on a. 19 (Introd. and on y. 31), 3. 5. 56, and 4. a. 57: l
mean his affectation, in poems where we have been wrought higher
than usual, of a rather dull, even conventional, ending, as though the
passion ought to die away in a diminuendo before the strain ceases
When we are looking for exemplifications of either of these feelings
in the position of a particular Ode, we must remember that they may
pass again by shades hard to detine into the mere sense of the relief
afforded by contrast, an unwillingness to dwell too long on any one
note. An instance, where we cannot doubt an artistic purpose in the
juxtaposition, and where this purpose seems to hesitate between the
first and second feeling which we have traced, is to be seen in 1. 37,
38, where we must notice that the slight Ode, with its picture of
