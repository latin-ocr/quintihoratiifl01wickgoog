HORATII CARMINUM

Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum
Collegisse iuvat metaque fervidis

Evilata rotis palmaque nobilis

Terrarum dominos evehit ad deos;
Hune, si mobilium turba Quiritium

‘rerum tutela mearum ς’ Virg. G. r. 40
‘O decus, O famae merito pars maxima
nostrae? Notice that here, as with the
corresponding word in the other pas-
sages, ‘meum' is in the emphatic place,
‘to me'

3. sunt quos .. iuvat. ‘Sunt qui'
may take either a Subjunctive, in which
case ‘qui' has its consecutive force:
‘sunt qui dicant‚' ‘there are people to
say:' or an indicative, in which case
‘sunt-qui‚' like ‘nescio quis,' becomes
a new pronoun, the subjectos a definite
categorical statement. The fonner is
the more Latin construction, more con·
sonant with the usages of the Relative‚
and is preferred in prose, although the
Iudicatire is also found, as in Sall. Cat.
19. 4, where see Kritz' note. Horace,
swayed perhaps by his love of Greek
constructione prefers the Indicative.
after the model of εἰσὶν οἵ. Cp. Od. 1.
7. 5, Sat.1. 4. 24, a. 1. 1, etc. But he
uses the subjunctive also, Sat. 1. a.
28, r. 4. 74, Epp. 1. 1. 77. InEpp. a. 2.
183 ‘Sunt qui non habeant, est quinon
curat habere‚' he seems to use the two
constructione as a means of contrasting
the vagueness of a general statement
with the definiteness cf a known par·
ticular instance. ‘There are who have
not, 1 know one who cares not to
have?

curriculo may mean either the
‘course’ as in Cic. Mur. ²7 ‘quadri-
gamm curriculum} or the ‘chariot,' as
in Ov. Trist. 4. 8 ‘ curriculo gravis est
lactamina meo)

4. collegisse. On comparison with
Sat. 1. 4. 31 ‘pulvis collectus turbine‚'
perhaps rather ‘to have raised a cloud
of dust' than ‘to have become dusty.'
The perf. may be regular, but see on 3.
4· 5²· , , ,

servisne, Virg. G. 3.167 ‘volat vr
fervidus axis3’ the object was to round
the ‘metae' as closely as possible, and
with the chariot going at full speed.

5. palma nobilia, ‘the palm of
glory‚’ Paus. 8. 48 ss δὲ τὴν δεξιάν ἐστι
καὶ πανταχοῦ τῷ νικῶντι ἐστιθέμενος

perric.

6. terrarum dominos. The iuter-
pretation of these words must depend
to a great extent on the decision of the
question discussed in the next note.
(1) If the punctuation given in the text
is adopted, so that v. 6 belongs to the
preceding sentence. they may best be
taken with Dillenburger as=⁶ quasi sint
facti terrarum domini,' ‘raises them to
heaven, very lords of the world,' i. e. in
their own feeling and estimation. Cp.
Od. 4. a. 17 ‘quos Elea domum reducit
Palma caelestes! Ovid (ex Pont. 1. 9.
36) gives the title ‘Terrarum domini’ to
the gods themselves, and so it is taken
here by many editore. The soree would
really be the same; for to name a spe-
cial characteristic of the gods is in
effect to qualify the sense of ‘evehit ad
deos,' ‘raises them to the gods in so
far as the gods are ‘⁶ terrarum domini,'”
‘makes them like gods. lurds of the
world! A less probable view, follow·
ing Lucan's use of the words (8. 208, of
Eastem princes), makes them the direct
object of ‘evehit’ and understands
them of the princes celebrated by
Pindar, as Hiero, Thero, etc. (2) If the
verse belongs to the sentence which
follows, ‘Terrarum dominos' may be
taken, according to the suggestion first
made by Glareanus, as adesignation
of the Romans who are contrasted with
the Greeks, the objects of the preceding
verses. Cp. the contrast of the two

as Virgil’s ‘Romanos rerum dominos'

¹ Aen. 1. 282; but Mr. Yonge rightly

points out that in Virgil it is used of the
Romans collectively. and that we still lack
proof that it could have been tolerated
if used, as it would be here, of indi·

7-9. hunc. . illum. We must sup-
ply 'iuvat’ from v. 4. The interpo-
sition of the fresh verb ‘evehit’ has
been felt to. be a difficulty. Bentley
avoided it by altering ‘evehit' to
‘evehere' which he took with ‘nobilis,’
as ‘ superare pugnis nobilem’ Od. 1. 12.
