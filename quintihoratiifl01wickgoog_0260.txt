ODE XXI.

Wrurreu in anticipation oi entertaining M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Dillf.
bids us compare with this Ode Epp. 1. 5.

‘Caslc of Massic, as old as myself, your potent contenis were kept for some
happy occasion, and they shall be broached to-day for Corvinus. He, philosopher
as he ie, will not despise you. Old Cato, they tell us, did not object to a cup of
wine. lfou maire genius tlow; you give fresh hope to the anxious and courage to

ἵ , the poor. With your help, and Liber and Venus and the Graece, we will keep the
banquet up till daylight!

Corvinus (the ‘Messalla' of Sat. 1. 6. 42, 1. ro. 85, A. Ρ. 371 ‘diserti Mes-
sallae') was, like Pollio, at once distinguished in the political and the literary
world. He had belonged to the senatoriam party, and turned Octavius’ fiank in
the first day‘s fighting at Philippi. He subsequently joined Octavius against
Antony, and commanded the centre of his fleet at Aetium. After the settlement
he retired from active life, and devoted himself to oratory and literature. He was
the great friend and patron os Tibullus.

With the fourth aud fifth stanzas should be compared Ovid's imitation, A. A. 1.
237 foll:—

‘Vina parant animos faciuntque caloribus aptos;
Cura fugit, multo diluiturque mero.
Tunc veniunt risus, tuuc pauper cornua sumit;
Tune dolor et curae rugaque frontis abit:
Tunc aperit mentes aero rarissima nostro
Simplicitas, artes excutiente deo'3

’ and the fragment of Maecenas' ‘Symposium' which Ritter quotes from Servius on
the words ‘faciles oculos' in Virg. Aen. 8. 310: ‘Hoc . . etiarn Maecenas iu Sym-
posio cui Vergilius et Horatius interfuerunt, curn err persona Messallae devino
loqueretur, aii: idem humor ministret faciles ocellos, pulchriore reddit omitia, et duleis
iuuentae redueat bena?
