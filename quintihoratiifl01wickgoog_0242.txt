ODE XII.

Trrrs Ode seems to be rightly taken by Orelli and Dssk'. as a soliloquy put into
the mouth of Neobule. ¹ She is one of the unhappy maidens who can neither give
free play to their love nor forget it over the wine cup without the dread oi an
unele's fieree tongue. She cannot attend to her womanly work fur the thought of
Hebrus' beauty,-Hebrus‚ as he' comes fresh sronr his swim in the Tiber aiter his
morning's exereise‚ sothe is the best of riders. boxers,1unners‚hintsmen.’

The older theory made it all an address of the poet to Neobule. But in his
mouth the contrast of the lot of rnen and women is not very graceiuh nor the con-
nection between vv. 1-3 and the remainder of the Ode very clear, nor the recitat of
Hebrus' aecomplishrnents very appropriate, Ritter‚ alloying the whole to be put
into Neobule's mouth, makes vv, 4-12 the ‘patruae verbera linguae’ which she
imagines to herself. The uncle, however, would harldy spend the greater part of
his scolding in praising her lover.

Gesner follows Acron in taking the whole as ironical, ‘Sotadieo versu? The
idea seems to have arisen from an attempt to interpret the names ‘Hebrus'
(ep. 1. 25. 20) as ‘Vetulus quidam et odiosus’; ‘Liparaeus' as ‘blear-eyed,’

¹ Ἴ ‘Vulcanlike' There are no other indicatione oi such arneaning in the Ode.

The verse which Hephaestion quotes, to illustrate the Ionio mette, from the
beginning of a poeni oi Alcaeus, ἔμε bellov ἔμε παισᾶν κακοτάτων πεδέχοισαν, reads
as if Alcaeus' Ode had been in some way the original of this one, and it favours
also the view that N eobule is speaking in this Ode oi herself.
