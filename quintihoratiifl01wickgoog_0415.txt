It is obvious that ve have here variations of tivo movements3
verse β repeats and amplifies the movement of the first half of a,
verse y repeats the dactylic movement of the second half, putting
the trochees after instead of before it. This consideration proves
that although to the ear the movement of β and of the first hall of a
is lambio, it was in idea a sequence ol trochees preceded by an
unemphatic syllable or ‘anacrusis' The anacrusis is as often short
as long in the fragments of Alcaeus and Sappho ln Horace it is
occasionally short, but more rarely in β than in a, and never in either
in Book iv.

Alcaeus had admitted a spondee in the place os the second trochee. .

Horace rnade the spondee imperative, see on Od. 3. 5. 77, 3, 23. 18.

The division of the two halves ol the lineis marked by a caesura,
which is only violated twice, in Od. 1. 37. 14 ‘Mentemque lymphatam
