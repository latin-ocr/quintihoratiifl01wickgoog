174 ιιοιιιιιιι carminum

Alexandriam (a town in the Troad) vel Ilium translatis simul opibus imperii
exhaustaque Italia delentibus et procuratione urbium amicis permissa' It has
been suggested that this idea imputed to Caesar, and eventually carried out by
Constantine, may have been in men’s minds, and that Horace, possibly at the
inspiration οι Augustus, sets himself ιο disconrage ιι. His protest, however, is an
empty one. The mythological argument could not be serious, and no other is
brought forward. Dillenburger, with more likelihood, imagines that the poet’s
purpose is to condemn Trojan manners, Asiatic perfidy aud luxury, and that the
rebnilding os Troy is an allegory, suggested perhaps by the rumour before meu·
tioned of Julius Caesar's design. Cp. Carm. Sec. ιι foll.. etc.

The Ode is more ιιι Pindar¹s style than any that precedes it. The mythologice]
part οιιι rtoccupies alarger space, is handled wrt 'th more freedom, and is left more
completelyt otell ιιι own t.ale Cp.3.11aud3‚ 27.

Several MSS, rncludingVand A (B omits tsOdesz fi), wrote his Ode con ιιιιι
ouslyt with the Second3 and Porphyrion, noticingt the question, decides ttha tthey
‘manifest te cohaerent? The aut thorit tyof the MSS. on the point (sect In trod. ιο ι.
7) is weakened by the fact that the same ones join 2.15 and 16, evidently wrongly.
Ode 2 has no unity which would be injured byn closer connection with 3, and the
topic of its last two stamas is not allento the praise of justice and constancy.
Porphyrion is inclined to press too hard the connection between the six Odes; see
on v. l. of Ode 4.
