HORATII CARMINUM

Qui primus alma risit adorea,
*Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas
Ceu flamma per taedas vel Eurus
Per Siculas equitavit undas.
'Post hoc secundis usque laboribus
Romana pubes crevit, et impio
Vastata Poenorum tumultu
Fana deos habuere rectos ¹
Dixitque tandem perfidus Hannibal:
*Cervi luporum praeda rapacium,
Sectamur ultra, quos opimus
Fallere et effugere est triumphus.

41. qui primus, the first day of
brightness and victory since Hannibal
,began hiscampaign ¹in Italy. There
might have been victorias before, as that
of Nola gained by M. Claudius Mar-
cellus in a c. 2153 but this was the first
decisive victory, the turning point of the
war. Appian (p. 344, De Bell. Annib.)
speaks os it asioorrrinov [τῇ ἐπὶ Κάνναις
ἀτυχίᾳ]

’ morea The recognised meaning of
‘adorea' was ⁶ glory won in war‚’ audit
was derived from ‘ador' π ‘corn'
*‘ Gloriam ..a ,farris honore adoream
appellabant? Plin. N. H. 18. 5. The
original connection is more doubtful.
Pliny explains it of the donative of corn
given to the soldiers after a victory,
N. H. a. 18. Festus, s. v, refers it, like
such words as ‘ pecunia: to an ,agricul-
tural age: ‘adoream laudern sive glo·
riam dicebant quia gloriosum eum puta·
bant esse qui farris copia .abundaret.’
Servius on Virg. Aen. 10. 677, hasa
still wilder derivation for it, from ‘adoro’

42. dirus3 see on a. ra. a.

ut, ‘ ever since,' as, in Epod. 7. 19, Cic.

Rrut. 5 ‘ut illos libros edidisti nihila te
¹postea accepimns?
’ 43 ceu. This is the only place
where this word is used by Horace.
The images are of the speed and vic-
toriousness of Hannibal's progress: ‘like
lire through a piae-forest, or the east
wind sweeping the Sicilian sea'

44. Siculam see on a. 12. 2. Horace
may be referring to his own experience
(see 3. 4. νδ), but it is alsopossible that
both the ‘Sicilian' waters aad the
zrnetapb. of ‘equitavit'are due to Eur.
Phoen. 209 περιρῤύτων ὑπὲρ ἀκαρπίστων

πεδίων Σικελίας Ζεφίνρου πνοαῖς irasci*
πανποε, arb. In its simple sense, and
as a matter of construction, the verb
belongs to Hannibal3 metaphorically
and with a zeugma, it supplies also the
verb of ‘ flamma’ ancl ⁴ Eurus!

45. secundis laboribus crevit,
grew ever more and more successful in
its enterprises; the ablativa as in 3. 50.
8 ‘crescam laude.'

46. impio, because they affronted
Roman gods.

47. Poenorum tumultu. A ‘tu-
multus’ wasa sudden and dangerous
waren or within the borders, usually a
Gallie orritalian one. Cicero explains
its nature in Phil. 8. 1. Cp. especially,
‘ltaque maiores nostri tumultum Itali-
cum quod erat domesticus, tumultum
Gallicum-quod erat ltaliae finitimus,
praetereanullumtumultumnominabaut.'
The expression, then, in the text is al-
mostanoxymoron.‘awarwithCarthagin-
ians, but yet awar in our own borders.’

48. deosrectos, of the imagesthrown

down by Hannibal, and now set on

their pedestals again.

49. The speech of Hannibal is founded
on me saying actually attributed to him
by Livy on learning of Hasdrubal's
deleat and death: ‘tanto simul publico
familiarique ictus luctu, agnoscere se
fortunam Kardraginis fertur dixisse,’
Liv. 27. 51.

perfidus. It was the stock charge
against him. Livy speaks of his ‘perli-
dia plusquam Punica' 21. 4.

51. ultro, agressively, needlessly.

opimus triumphus, ‘a rare triumph,’
a phrase coined by Horace to the model
of ⁴ spolia opima?
