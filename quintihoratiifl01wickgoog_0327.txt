ODE IX.

‘Do not despise the office of the lyric poet, Lollius Pindar's poems lire, uncx-
tinguished by Homer's greater name3 and so do those of Simonides Alcaeus
Stesichorus¹ Anacreon, Sappho. Before Homer sang, manya Helen loved, many
aTroy was besieged, many a Hector or Deiphobus fought and died for wife and
children. Why are they unwept, unknown? Because they had no inspired chroni-
cler; and, when once forgotten, what good is left of their heroism? It shall not
be so with you, Lollius, if I can help it. lfou have the mind of a statesman-clear
sighted, well balanced, proof against ararica, ruler of all things, because it rules
itself. Such is the one wisc and happy man, who is independent of circumstances
who can use prosperity well, aud not shrink from porerty or death in a good
cause.’

Lollius (¹ M. Lollius M. F! His cognomen is unknown ; see on Epp. 1. a. 1)
had been consul no. 21 (Epp. 1. ao. 28). For his temporary defeat by the Sygam-
’ bri in ac. 16 see Introd. to this Book. His character stands very low with
other writers. Pliny, H. N. 9. 35. 58, and Vell. Patere. a. 9, accuse him specially
of avarice and venality. This is in strange contradiction to Horace's panegyrim in
which such stress is laid on his freedom from these particular vices. The public
voice can hardly, at the time Horace wrote, have endorsed the accusatione, or the
boldness of meeting Lollius' calumniators on their own ground would have raised
ridicule rather than sympathy. Something no doubt must be deducted from Vel-
leius’ testimony on the scere of his partiality to Tiberius, whose eumity Lollius
had specially incurred (Suet. Tib. 12, 15), and Pliny would very likely have followed
Velleius. But Lollius, notwithstanding the failure of his German campaign, con-
tinued in the intimacy and confidence of Augustus, as is shown by the fact that he
