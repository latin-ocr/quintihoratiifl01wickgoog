of the old affection, but (1) we have no hint now of his being still
interested in politics, a change which tallies with the date assigned by
Dio (54. 19) to his loss of Augustus' favour and retirement from
public affairs in 11. 0. 163 and (a) he is no longer the patron to whose
praise Horace looks as his highest reward. The three Books of Odes
have been published for some time, and the verdict anticipared 111
3. 3011001100110000111011101110111. Their author is now the intimate
of Augustus. He hasbeen selected to composa the hymn for the
Secular GameS, and the public voice ratiiied the emperor’s choice.
He is now writing, notin the hope of winning a name for himself, but
at Augustus' desire, and because his praise will confessedly give lustre
to the emperor and his family. ’ ’ s

It may be added, that the versification of the leading Odes gives
some witness to the lateness of their composition; the Sapphic Odes
in the frequency of the heremimeral caesura, which assimilates them
to the Carm. Sec.; and the Alcaic in the greater strietness with respect
to the structure of v. goi the stanna, and the complete exclusiones
the short anacrusis in vy. 1, a, 3 (see 11111011 01 Metres).

It has been said before (p. 8) that Book iv exhibits more proofs
of artistic purpose in irs arrangement than any other collection of
Horace's poems.

1. The most obvious instance, perhaps, is the disposition of the
four Odes for the sake of which we may say the Book was composed.
They stand in two pairs <evidently not on any chronological ground,
for Ode 6 must be at least two years earlier than any of them) at the
beginning of the Book (after a prelude, which will be noticed pre·
000111) 01111 at its end. Each pair is divided between Augustus and
0110 01 the young princes; so that any praises of the latter may 000111
to lead up to and merge themselves 111 the glory of the former.

2. Scarcely less noticeable is the sequence of thought expressed or
suggested in the three Odes which precede the main theme. It has
been remarked before (p. 9111101 a somewhat similar relation may 110
traced in the first Ode of Book 1 ; but the prelude here is more
elaborate, and the irony is 111010 conscious. He has been asked to
take up his 1110 again to sing the glory of the emperor and his step·
sons, and he begins as usual with ‘denial vain and coy excuse! ‘He
will take his lyre, indeed, but it is at Venus' bidding, to renew under
her compulsion the bitter—sweet themes which he hoped he had laid
aside.' Ode a is to the same purport, though it carries us a little
further by the end. ‘He is no swan of Pindaric song, such as is
needed for so high a task. Some greater poet, Antonius himself,
